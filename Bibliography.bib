In two localities, sympatric Anolis species with differential occurrences in sun or shade sought lower, more shaded perches during midday, resulting in partly nonsynchronous utilization of the vegetation by the two species. The second observation may be related to the first in the following way: nonsynchronous spatial overlap could dictate relatively great resource overlap for species coinhabiting patchy or edge areas, requiring great differences between the species in prey size in addition to those in climatic habitat. The extent of such overlap on small depauperate islands could be greater if these contained a greater proportion of patchy or edge habitats (with respect to insolation), or if climatic preferences were broader and more overlapping than on large, species—rich islands. In each locality, the relatively more shade—inhabiting species occurred more often on larger perches and on lower perches than did the other species. In both species of the Bermudan pair, adult males occupied higher and larger perches, and in grahami, shadier perches, than did female—sized individuals. The statistical significance of these and other differences was evaluated using several unweighted g2 procedures, Cochran's weighted g2 test and a partitioning technique for analyzing interactions among variables in complex contingency tables. The last method is described in detail in the papaer by Fienberg, immediately following this one.},

	abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate that eggs from anadromous salmonines can constitute a large proportion of the dietary intake of individual juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta during the spawning period in late autumn. The majority of fish older than 1 year residing on a spawning ground were found to have ingested eggs from spawning salmonines (Salmo sp.). Young-of-the-year brown trout were also able to consume eggs, at least down to a minimum fork length of 68 mm. The smallest Atlantic salmon found to have consumed eggs had a fork length of 79 mm. Larger fish were more likely to consume eggs, and consumed more eggs, than smaller individuals. The eggs of anadromous salmonines provide a rich source of marine-derived nutrients to the freshwater residing juveniles at the onset of winter. Our study highlights that these eggs may constitute an important energy input for juvenile salmonines in European anadromous populations, and could possibly influence winter survival rates and subsequent smoltification in the following spring.},

	abstract = {We examined how the spatially and temporally predictable disturbance caused by a spawning run of native sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka temporarily affected benthic and invertebrate drift communities of two small streams in southwestern Alaska. Surface gravel size temporarily increased as a consequence of this mechanical disturbance, and periphyton biomass decreased in one stream. The postspawning rise in periphyton biomass in Bear Creek (larger sockeye salmon run) likely reflects nutrient release by decomposing sockeye salmon. Total benthic invertebrate and larval chironomid density decreased during spawning in one stream, but most invertebrate taxa in both streams did not exhibit clear spawning-related impacts. In contrast, invertebrate drift almost always increased during daylight hours when sockeye salmon were present, but it was difficult to separate mechanical effects of sockeye salmon acting via redd construction versus swimming. Total daytime drift density during spawning was four times greater in Bear Creek (4 sockeye salmon/m stream) and 2.5 times greater in Whitefish Creek (0.5 sockeye salmon/m stream), compared with pre- and postspawning values. In experimental enclosures, total drift and drift by Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Hydracarina (water mites), and Plecoptera (stoneflies) were also significantly higher in the presence of swimming sockeye salmon. Juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch consumed significantly more chironomid larvae during spawning in Whitefish Creek, apparently capitalizing on the increased chironomid drift caused by the spawning-run disturbance. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of salmonids to the stream ecosystems in which they spawn, with reference to benthic community structure and increased access to invertebrates in the drift by resident fishes},

	abstract = {We produced a spatially explicit assessment of the changes in stocking, catch, fishing effort, and catch per effort ({CPE}) for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in Lakes Michigan and Huron from 1986 to 2011. We focused on describing spatial differences in the changes that occurred during three well-known episodes of rapid change: (1) a decline in abundance during 1986-1994 in Lake Michigan, (2) a recovery in abundance during 1994-2006 in Lake Michigan, and (3) a decline in abundance during 2002-2010 in Lake Huron. We used a spatial grid system to describe and contrast trends in fishing effort and {CPE} among the main lake basins (Michigan, Huron, and Georgian) and subregions within those basins. We applied linear regressions, {ANCOVAs}, and Tukey’s tests to assess differences. We found that trends differed among and within basins during all three episodes, which resulted in changes in the distribution of fishing effort and {CPE}. Fishing effort generally decreased in all basins and subregions over the entire 25 years, but it decreased less in areas where {CPE} had increased. The timing of the recovery episode and second mortality episode overlapped, so {CPE} simultaneously increased from 79 to 139 fish/1,000 h of fishing in the Michigan basin and decreased from 65 to 35 fish/1,000 h of fishing in the Huron basin. Movement of fishing effort and Chinook Salmon from the Huron basin to the Michigan basin probably occurred during this time. The {CPE} did not change significantly in the Georgian basin. Within basins, {CPE} exhibited sharp declines of more than 80\% in some subregions during both mortality episodes but declined much less or not at all in others. After the recovery episode, areas of highest {CPE} in the Michigan basin had shifted from eastern subregions to western subregions.},

	abstract = {Lake Michigan supports popular fisheries for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that have been sustained by stocking since the late 1960s. Natural recruitment of Chinook Salmon in Lake Michigan has increased in the past few decades and currently contributes more than 50\% of Chinook Salmon recruits. We hypothesized that selective forces differ for naturalized populations born in the wild and hatchery populations, resulting in divergent life history characteristics with implications for Chinook Salmon population production and the Lake Michigan fishery. First, we conducted a historical analysis to determine if life history characteristics changed through time as the Chinook Salmon population became increasingly naturalized. Next, we conducted a 2-year field study of naturalized and hatchery stocked Chinook Salmon spawning populations to quantify differences in fecundity, egg size, timing of spawning, and size at maturity. In general, our results did not indicate significant life history divergence between naturalized and hatchery-stocked Chinook Salmon populations in Lake Michigan. Although historical changes in adult sex ratio were correlated with the proportion of naturalized individuals, changes in weight at maturity were better explained by density-dependent factors. The field study revealed no divergence in fecundity, timing of spawning, or size at maturity, and only small differences in egg size (hatchery {\textgreater} naturalized). For the near future, our results suggest that the limited life history differences observed between Chinook Salmon of naturalized and hatchery origin will not lead to large differences in characteristics important to the dynamics of the population or fishery.},

	abstract = {Large-scale stocking programs have been used to introduce and maintain Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha fisheries in the Laurentian Great Lakes since the late 1960s, with discoveries of naturalized populations in tributaries soon after the initial introduction. Characterizing ecological differences between hatchery and naturalized Chinook Salmon is becoming increasingly important for sustainable management of this species. We hypothesized that nonheritable traits (i.e., homing) and artificial selection might result in different habitat use and arrival timing between rearing origins occupying the same river, with the potential for reproductive isolation and divergence of naturalized and hatchery strains. In 2010 and 2011, using visual observations and {PIT} tags, we tracked individual hatchery and naturalized Chinook Salmon that spawned in the Sydenham River (Owen Sound, Ontario), one of the first tributaries in Lake Huron to be colonized by hatchery strays and establish a naturalized population. We estimated that 52–58\% of the 3,200–3,300 fish returning to spawn in 3.5 km of accessible spawning habitat were hatchery fish. In females, the extent of prespawning movement increased with arrival date, decreased with fish length, and was lower for hatchery fish. Hatchery females also displayed a higher probability of direct homing to the stocking site than naturalized females. Prespawning movements by males were extensive but did not depend on rearing origin, arrival timing, or body size. We found no evidence of reproductive isolation, however. Spatial distributions of spawning locations were independent of rearing origin for both sexes, and arrival timing in the river was similar between rearing origins for both sexes. The lack of reproductive isolation is likely attributable to the small area of suitable habitat in this river. Our study represents the first comprehensive comparison of spawning habitat use and timing by hatchery and naturalized Chinook Salmon in the Great Lakes.

	abstract = {Abstract This study was undertaken to determine what effects a spawning run of coho salmon would have on the benthos of the Platte River, Benzie County, Michigan. It was hypothesized that the physical disruption of the substrate, by spawning salmon, would reduce the density of benthos by dislodging the organisms and causing their downstream displacement. Estimates of density of benthic invertebrates were made in two control sections (salmon excluded) and in one experimental section (salmon having free access) in May and August 1967 prior to coho spawning run, and in December 1967 and May 1968 after the run. Coho spawning activity in the fall of 1967 disturbed the bottom materials. The densities of 12 taxa, as well as the total number and total weight of organisms per square foot, decreased significantly in samples collected in December after disruption. The decrease in total number of organisms per square foot in the experimental section as compared to the controls was 270.5; the decrease in weight in the experimental section was 1.97 grams. This is a percent decrease in the experimental section relative to the controls of 66\% for total number and 78\% for total weight. In May 1968, the number of organisms per square foot was still significantly lower in the experimental section (57.4 per square foot), but weight of organisms per square foot was not. The percent decrease in the experimental section relative to the controls for total number was 39\%. Three of twelve taxa, whose density was reduced in the fall of 1967, were still lower in May 1968. Complete recovery of benthos was not observed in the 5-month period from December to May.},

	doi = {10.1080/00028487.2013.862176},
	abstract = {We combined statistical stock assessment methods with bioenergetic calculations to assess historical changes in abundance and consumptive demand of the hatchery-supported salmonine community in Lake Michigan, with the goal of providing information needed to examine the lake's predator-prey balance. Especially for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, the most dominant salmonine predator in the lake, our analysis revealed density-dependent changes in growth, survival, production levels, consumptive demand, and fishery characteristics, suggesting that increased salmonine abundance possibly had substantial impacts on prey abundance that led to predators being food limited. Indeed, the estimated changes in the salmonine community were consistent with historical changes in prey abundances that were previously documented for Lake Michigan. Specifically, higher salmonine abundance and consumption were estimated for the early 1980s, during which time Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus abundance experienced a marked decline, leading to a Chinook Salmon mass mortality event in 1987. Similarly, increased salmonine abundance and consumption were estimated for the years since the early 2000s, and the Alewife population in Lake Michigan has been driven to historically low levels during these years. Increased salmonine abundance estimates in recent years were attributable to improved survival rates and natural reproduction of Chinook Salmon. Although past revisions to stocking rates may have been reasonable measures taken to stabilize the predator-prey system, our analysis suggests that recent reductions in stocking have not been sufficient to reduce predatory pressure on the Alewife population; however, they may have ameliorated potential effects of increased natural reproduction of Chinook Salmon. Along with a complementary assessment of the production dynamics of key prey species, our retrospective assessment of the dynamics of the Lake Michigan predator community and their consumptive demands can provide the basis for making future fishery management decisions from an ecosystem perspective.

Loss of spawning habitat, bycatch mortality in the directed pelagic fisheries, increased predation mortality by rebounding predators such as Striped Bass, changes in water flow and temperature affecting recruitment success, changes in ocean thermal habitat and direct and indirect effects of changes in zooplankton community have been expounded by different researchers as putative hypotheses for population changes in Alewife. Unfortunately, long-term, concurrently-measured time series of regional factors and direct measures of biological processes needed to elucidate underlying causes are severely lacking for Alewife. Therefore, we developed, calibrated and validated a mechanistic, spatially-explicit, full life-cycle simulation model that can be used to explore population responses of Alewife to various exogeneous drivers. Daily processes such as spawning, recruitment, mortality, exploitation, predation and movements are generated by using empirically-derived deterministic and stochastic relationships and time-series of environmental data linked to specific life stages. We demonstrate the use of the model as an investigative tool by simulating three hypotheses and comparing model results to observed trends in Alewife populations from southern New England.},

River herring populations have not rebounded despite reductions in directed fishing on these species and improvements in their freshwater and estuarine habitats. We examined recent (2005-2009) spatial and temporal patterns of fishing effort in the {US} fishery for Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, and river herring bycatch patterns in this fishery. During the year, Atlantic herring fishing activity shifts spatially and temporally from the Northern Mid-Atlantic Bight and Southern New England waters in January-February, to Southern New England waters in March-April, to the Gulf of Maine in May-June, expanding to the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank in July-August and September-October, respectively, and then contracting to the Gulf of Maine and Southern New England waters in November-December. At-sea fisheries observer data indicate that river herring bycatches in the Atlantic herring fishery occur mostly during January-April and September-December, primarily in Southern New England and the Northern Mid-Atlantic Bight waters. We discuss possible management measure to reduce these bycatches. Similar size, shape, and schooling behaviors between river herring and other pelagic species-and the high volume nature of the Atlantic herring fishery-limit the potential efficacy of gear-based bycatch mitigation measures. Hence, approaches such as regulatory management measures (e.g., time-area closures and catch caps) and improved fleet communication strategies (e.g., "move-on" rules) may be more practical and effective in minimizing river herring bycatch in the Atlantic herring fishery. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We found that geographic variables and species-specific prey resources were significantly associated with consumption rates, a pattern consistent with predator-prey theory. Prey categories comprised of fish were particularly important for a more mobile predator (silver hake Merluccius bilinearis), whereas benthic invertebrate prey were consistently important for a more sedentary predator (little skate Raja erinacea). Hotspots in consumption rates that overlap with particular prey resources were highlighted by the significance of location variables (longitude) for winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus, silver hake, little skate, and sea raven Hemitripterus americanus. Depth was an important explanatory factor for consumption by little skate, but the explanatory value of abiotic habitat factors was low for the other three species.

We present examples and use cases, ranging from data exploration to visualizing scientific findings. Static spatial plots of movement data disregard the temporal dimension that distinguishes movement from other spatial data. In contrast, animations allow to display relocation in both time and space.

As a first step toward understanding population size, spatial distribution, and spawning habitat of adult sea lampreys in the {SCDRS}, we used acoustic telemetry to determine where sea lampreys ceased migration (due to spawning, death, or both) among major regions of the {SCDRS}. All tagged sea lampreys released in the lower Detroit River (N = 27) moved upstream through the Detroit River and entered Lake St. Clair. After entering Lake St. Clair, sea lampreys entered the St. Clair River (N = 22), Thames River (N = 1), or were not detected again (N = 4). Many sea lampreys (10 of 27) were last observed moving downstream (“fallback”) but we were unable to determine if those movements occurred before or after spawning, or while sea lampreys were dead or alive. Regardless of whether estimates of locations where sea lampreys ceased migration were based on the most upstream region occupied or final region occupied, most sea lampreys ceased migration in the St. Clair River or Lake St. Clair. Results suggest that spawning and rearing in the St. Clair River could be an important determinant of sea lamprey recruitment in the {SCDRS} and may direct future assessment and control activities in that system.},

	abstract = {Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in the Gulf of Maine were surveyed using fisheries-independent systematic and stratified-random surveys conducted annually by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center from 1998 to 2012 during autumn. The systematic surveys were dedicated to surveying Atlantic herring and were designed to be synchronous with pre-spawning, whereas the stratified-random surveys were broad-scale, multi-species surveys. Both types of surveys collected multi-frequency acoustic and trawl data. These surveys were analyzed to evaluate their individual effectiveness as surveys, whether results could be combined, or whether either survey could be used alone to estimate Atlantic herring abundance. With the exception of two years, more Atlantic herring in the water column were observed in the Georges Bank region during the dedicated systematic survey than later in the season by the stratified-random survey in the Georges Bank and northern Gulf of Maine regions. These observations suggest that the systematic survey was not out of synchrony with Atlantic herring spawning in the Georges Bank area, and the majority of spawning in the off-shore Gulf of Maine region occurred in the Georges Bank area. Additionally, the area backscattering time series showed no dramatic changes among surveys conducted with different vessels, suggesting that the Atlantic herring did not react substantially to changes in vessels and/or reacted similarly to the presence of any of the four vessels used. © 2014.},

	abstract = {Background: Acoustic telemetry, for tracking fish movement histories, is multidimensional capturing both spatial and temporal domains. Oftentimes, analyses of such data are limited to a single domain, one domain nested within the other, or ad hoc approaches that simultaneously consider both domains. Sequence analysis, on the other hand, offers a repeatable statistical framework that uses a sequence alignment algorithm to calculate pairwise dissimilarities among individual movement histories and then hierarchical agglomerative clustering to identify groups of fish with similar movement histories. The objective of this paper is to explore how acoustic telemetry data can be fit to this statistical framework and used to identify commonalities in the movement histories of acoustic-tagged sea lamprey during upstream migration through the St. Clair-Detroit River System. Results: Five significant clusters were identified among individual fish. Clusters represented differences in timing of movements (short vs long duration in the Detroit R. and Lake St. Clair); extent of upstream migration (ceased migration in Lake St. Clair, lower St. Clair R., or upper St. Clair R.), and occurrence of fallback (return to Lake St. Clair after ceasing migration in the St. Clair R.). Inferences about sea lamprey distribution and behavior from these results were similar to those reached in a previous analysis using ad-hoc analysis methods. Conclusions: The repeatable statistical framework outlined here can be used to group sea lamprey movement histories based on shared sequence characteristics (i.e., chronological order of "states" occupied). Further, this framework is flexible and allows researchers to define a priori the movement aspect (e.g., order, timing, duration) that is important for identifying both common or previously undetected movement histories. As such, we do not view sequence analysis as a panacea but as a useful complement to other modelling approaches (i.e., exploratory tool for informing hypothesis development) or a stand-alone semi-quantitative method for generating a simplified, temporally and spatially structured view of complex acoustic telemetry data and hypothesis testing when observed patterns warrant further investigation.},

This manual is essentially a tutorial that describes the features and usage of the {TraMineR} package. It may also serve, however, as an introduction to sequential data analysis. The presentation is illustrated with data from the social sciences. Illustrative data sets and R scripts (sequence of R-commands) 1 are included in the {TraMineR} distribution package. For newcomers to R, a short introduction to the R-environment is given in Appendix A in which the reader will learn where R can be obtained as well as its basic commands and principles. Appendix B explains how to install {TraMineR} in R, while Chapter 3 shortly explains how to use the package and describes the illustrative data sets provided with it.},

The originality of the study is the focus put on the differences between sequences that are sociologically important when studying life courses such as family life trajectories or professional careers. These differences essentially concern the sequencing (the order in which successive states appear), the timing and the duration of the spells in successive states. The study examines the sensitivity of the measures to these three aspects analytically and empirically by means of simulations. Even if some distance measures underperform, the study shows that there is no universally optimal distance index, and that the choice of a measure depends on which aspect we want to focus on. From the review and simulation results, the paper derives guidelines to help the end user to choose the right dissimilarity measure for her or his research objectives. This study also introduces novel ways of measuring dissimilarities that overcome some flaws in existing measures.},

Resident spawning groups and their subpopulations have disappeared and have yet to recover, causing local groundfish fisheries to collapse. Three additional gadid species, haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), pollock (Pollachius virens), and white hake (Urophyscus tenuis) collapsed along the northern coastal shelf during the same period, raising concerns that their resident coastal groups were part of a metapopulation and may have also been lost. Analysis of their distribution and movements in the 1920s appeared to corroborate this. The four gadids had clusters of resident coastal groups along the coastal shelf that coexisted in the same area. Cod, white hake and pollock appeared to exhibit metapopulation characteristics, having resident and migrating components distributed along the coast in three different areas, with migrating components arriving and leaving along common migration routes fall when alewives left. The groups were centered near rivers with alewife spawning runs and disappeared from the area during the 1950s after alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) declined locally. The results suggest that large, stable concentrations of young-of-the-year alewives were a factor in where resident and migrating gadid groups were located. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Three species of the stromateoid genus Peprilus have been found to occur in the northwest Atlantic: P. triacanthus (butterfish), P. burti (gulf butterfish), and P. alepidotus (harvestfish). Peprilus triacanthus and P. alepidotus reportedly spawn from May through August and June through July, respectively. Peprilus burti spawns twice yearly: February through May and September through November. Collections of larvae and juveniles of Peprilus spp. from the northern South Atlantic ({SAB}) and Mid-Atlantic ({MAB}) Bights during both the spring and summer of 1988 and 1989 suggest that either a combination of species was spawning or that reported spawning dates were suspect. Species identification of Peprilus in these collections was determined with morphometric, meristic, and pigment character analyses. Specimens sampled had counts for caudal vertebrae (18-19) and ventral midline melanophores (11-16) consistent with those found for P. triacanthus in previous studies. By analyzing otoliths, we estimated larval and juvenile growth rates to be approximately 0.23 mm/day. Back calculation of hatch dates suggests either two spawning events for P. triacanthus, February through mid-April and mid-May through late July, or one extended spawning period beginning in late February and ending in late July. This study reveals that P. triacanthus spawns for a much longer period than previously thought. It is possible that P. triacanthus spawns during the spring in the {SAB} and summer in the {MAB} as a strategy to extend the duration of its spawning period. This strategy is one used by other north-south migrating species and warrants further study.},

To investigate how these fisheries might develop in the future, we elicited projections from experts in fisheries and related fields. Experts provided assessments on variables relating to {US} and Canadian commercial (pounds landed) and sport (participation and expenditures) fisheries for the years 2006 and 2025. We measured each expert's ability to quantify their uncertainty, producing performance-weighted combinations of expert estimates. All experts expected commercial fisheries to decline from 2006 to 2025, with greater declines in the {US} (25\%) than in Canada (9\%). Expectations for sport fishing differed more between lakes and less between countries, with median expected declines ranging from 1\% to 13\%. Experts attributed expected declines primarily to changes in economic market demands and shifts in societal interests.

	abstract = {Acoustic telemetry has quickly become a powerful tool for ecological research in aquatic systems, yet our knowledge of in situ transmitter performance remains limited. Here, we used an experimental approach to test the influence of three biotic factors on the detection range of acoustic transmitters: (1) internal versus external placement of the transmitter on a model finfish species, red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus); (2) attachment of a transmitter on an animal host (red drum) versus a fixed object; and (3) species comparison between internally tagged red drum and southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma). Significant differences in detection probability were observed between internally and externally placed transmitters as well as between transmitters attached to an animal host (red drum) and those attached to a fixed line, while no effect was observed between the two species tested. External transmitters were detected significantly more than corresponding internal transmitters in red drum, and outperformed internal transmitters by 2-7 fold at distances {\textgreater}100m. Similarly, detection probability declined more quickly as a function of distance for transmitters attached to red drum relative to transmitters attached to a fixed line, with greater differences observed at distances {\textgreater}300m. Findings from this study challenge commonly held assumptions in acoustic telemetry research and suggest that traditional range testing methods are likely to considerably overestimate detection range of tagged animals in situ. Accounting for the influence of transmitter placement will enhance study design in acoustic telemetry research and ultimately improve detection efficiency and data interpretation in animal movement studies.},

Predators often exploit migrant prey, but the movements taken by these consumers are rarely studied or understood. We define such movements, where migrant prey induce large-scale movements of predators, as migratory coupling. Migratory coupling can have ecological consequences for the participating prey, predators and the communities they traverse across the landscape. We review examples of migratory coupling in the literature and provide hypotheses regarding conditions favourable for their occurrence. We also provide a framework for interactions induced by migratory coupling and demonstrate their potential community-level impacts by examining other forms of spatial shifts in predators. Migratory coupling integrates the fields of landscape, movement, food web and community ecologies, and represents an understudied frontier in ecology.},

	abstract = {The availability ofdetailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed pres- ence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use ofa variety ofstandard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number ofaspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy ofthe method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species ofsloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction ({GARP}). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests ofomission and receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analyses. The area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination ofsuitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

Fishery independent data collected with bag seines throughout the {GBC} from 1999 to 2009 were used to predict the probability of southern flounder occurrence. Binomial {GAMs} were used to assess presence/absence of southern flounder and models included temporal variables, benthic variables such as distance to habitats generated within a geographic information system, and physicochemical conditions of the water column. Separate models were generated for newly settled southern flounder, young-of-the-year ({YOY}) southern flounder observed in the summer, and {YOY} southern flounder observed in fall based on size and collection month. Factors affecting southern flounder occurrence changed seasonally, as did the corresponding shifts in the spatial distribution of suitable habitat. Temporal effects (year and month) were retained in all models. Physicochemical conditions (temperature, turbidity, and measures of environmental variability), and the presence of seagrass beds were influential for newly settled southern flounder. Distance to marine and/or freshwater sources were found to be important for {YOY} southern flounder in the summer and fall seasons. The abundance of brown shrimp was found to only influence the distribution of {YOY} southern flounder in the fall, when intermediate abundances of the potential prey item increased the occurrence of southern flounder. After model completion, the availability and spatial distribution of suitable habitat within the {GBC} was predicted using available environmental and spatial data for 2005. Spatial distributions of predicted suitable habitat stress the relative importance of West Bay during the newly settled stage and in the fall season, and Upper Bay during the summer and fall of the first year of life. These models demonstrate the potential dynamics of suitable habitats for juvenile southern flounder and provide insight into ontogenetic shifts in habitat preference during the first year of life. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We discuss definitions of the widely used first flowering date and revisit the literature on phylogenetic signal in plant phenology. We compare statistical analyses for tropical and temperate phenology by simulating communities with known phenological and phylogenetic structures. We demonstrate that ignoring the circular nature of phenological data underestimates the phylogenetic signal in plant phenology. Using the proposed circular transformation for non-resting tropical ecosystems and resting temperate systems prevented errors, yielding precise comparisons. Synthesis. The analysis of both non-resting and resting systems must consider the circularity of phenological events. Circular statistics is the appropriate approach to calculate phenological parameters, identify phylogenetic signal and assess drivers, allowing accurate cross-comparisons of phenology across environments at large spatial scales.},

We used a radio-acoustic positioning telemetry ({VRAP}) system to monitor detailed movements of 10 blue rockfish Sebastes mystinus around shallow rock pinnacles and stands of bull kelp Nereocystis leutkeana in central California in September 2002. The mean home range was 8783 m2 ± 1137 {SE}; however, activity was highly concentrated in 1 to 3 core areas within each home range. Mean core areas measured 1350 m2 ± 286 {SE}, but accounted for ∼83 \% of activity. All core areas were centered over rock pinnacles where rockfish were highly aggregated. Individuals exhibited high site fidelity and made only brief radial excursions away from these centers or moved directly from one pinnacle to the next along defined corridors.

	abstract = {Parametric kernel methods currently dominate the literature regarding the construction of animal home ranges ({HRs}) and utilization distributions ({UDs}). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull ({LoCoH}) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon ({MCP}) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing {HRs} and {UDs}, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the {LoCoH} in two ways: "fixed sphere-of-influence," or r-{LoCoH} (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius r of each reference point), and an "adaptive sphere-of-influence," or a-{LoCoH} (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to a), and compare them to the original "fixed-number-of-points," or κ-{LoCoH} (all kernels constructed from κ-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric {LoCoH} to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from {GPS} collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that {LoCoH} methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing {UDs} and {HRs} arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-{LoCoH} is generally superior to κ- and r-{LoCoH} (with software for all three methods available at http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu). © 2007 Getz et al.},

We compare our method with bivariate kernel and α-hull methods, using both randomly distributed and highly aggregated data to test the accuracy of area estimates and {UD} isopleth construction. The data variously contain holes, corners, and corridors linking high use areas. Our method is based on taking the union of the minimum convex polygons ({MCP}) associated with the k - l nearest neighbors of each point in the data and, as such, has one free parameter k. We propose a "minimum spurious hole covering" ({MSHC}) rule for selecting k and interpret its application in terms of type I and type {II} statistical errors. Our {MSHC} rule provides estimates within 12\% of true area values for all 5 data sets, while kernel methods are worse in all cases: in one case overestimating area by a factor of 10 and in another case underestimating area by a factor of 50. Our method also constructs much better estimates for the density isopleths of the {UDs} than kernel methods. The α-hull method does not lead directly to the construction of isopleths and also does not always include all points in the constructed home range. Finally we demonstrate that kernel methods, unlike our method and the α-hull method, does not converges to the true area represented by the data as the number of data points increase.},

	doi = {10.1644/11-mamm-s-172.1},
	abstract = {Statisticians frequently voice concern that their interactions with applied researchers start only after data have been collected. The same can be said for our experience with home-range studies. Too often, conversations about home range begin with questions concerning estimation methods, smoothing parameters, or the nature of autocorrelation. More productive efforts start by asking good (and interesting) research questions; once these questions are defined, it becomes possible to ask how various design and analysis strategies influence one's ability to answer these questions. With this process in mind, we address key sample-design and data-analysis issues related to the topic of home range. The impact of choosing a particular home-range estimator (e.g., minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, or local convex hull) will be question dependent, and for some problems other movement or use-based metrics (e.g., mean step lengths or time spent in particular areas) may be worthy of consideration. Thus, we argue the need for more question-driven and focused research and for clearly distinguishing the biological concept of an animal's home range from the statistical quantities one uses to investigate this concept. For comparative studies, it is important to standardize sampling regimes and estimation methods as much as possible, and to pay close attention to missing data issues. More attention should also be given to temporally changing space-use patterns, with biologically meaningful time periods (e.g., life-history stages) used to define sampling periods. Last, we argue the need for closer connections between theoretical and empirical researchers. Advances in ecological theory, and its application to natural resources management, will require carefully designed research studies to test theoretical predictions from more mechanistic modeling approaches. © 2012 American Society of Mammalogists.},

Despite the important top-down pressure this species likely exerts on fish communities within its foraging territories, the specifics of spatial ecology remain relatively unknown. This study tracked 17 great barracuda throughout Buck Island Reef National Monument, a marine-protected area located in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (17.786944° N, − 64.620556° W) from July 2014 to May 2016. Broad- and fine-scale acoustic telemetry was used to examine individual variability and study population patterns in residency, site fidelity, territoriality, and complexity of spatial use within home ranges. Network analysis of broad-scale data revealed spatial and temporal differentiation among the population in location of core use areas and showed that these areas contained multiple unique receiver groups or communities, a product of spatial or temporal variation within core activity spaces. Results from the fine-scale positioning system reinforced spatial and temporal partitioning in core use areas between individuals, indicating territorial behaviors, and showed evidence for both resident and transient movements. Preliminary fine-scale analysis also suggested diel variation in location of activity spaces. Although ubiquitous throughout all shallow water habitats, detection patterns for the study population appear to be influenced by high residency, territoriality, spatial partitioning, and diel variation. Understanding the complexities of individual space use is fundamental to ecologically founded and effective area-based spatial management frameworks at community scales.},

In experiment 1 we measured the respiration rates of two size-classes of age-0 rainbow trout five times at five different temperatures (9-19 degrees C).

We also use these data to develop a new parameter set for a Wisconsin bioenergetics model of maximum consumption and respiration rates for age-0 rainbow trout. The results show that individual differences have a significant effect on their respiration and maximum feed consumption rates. The new bioenergetics parameter set differs considerably from the parameter sets developed for adult rainbow trout. The new bioenergetics model may prove useful for studies examining the growth and feed consumption of age-0 rainbow trout. The finding of significant differences between individuals in measured rates of respiration and maximum consumption may be important in individual-based models ({IBMs}) of fish populations. Specifically, {IBMs} have not included individual-level differences in bioenergetic rates, but such differences may have an important effect on their predictions of fish growth, production, and population number.},

Seasonal and size-dependent diet composition was estimated based on an extensive analysis of smelt diets in Lakes Michigan and Ontario and a synthesis of published diet data for all of the Great Lakes. For each lake, we employed lake-specific temperature regimes, growth rates, mortality rates, and abundance estimates. Model simulations for the average individual rainbow smelt in the various lakes revealed gross food conversion efficiencies ({GCE}) of 13.8-15.8\% averaged over all age-classes. For the youngest age-class, {GCE} was usually close to 20\% and two or three times greater than for age-classes 4 and 5. An empirical estimate of daily ration in Lake Michigan in late August was between 0.017 and 0.037 g food/g smelt, depending on the value assumed for stomach evacuation rate. Our model predicted a ration of about 0.022 g-g ' for that same period. Total annual rainbow smelt production and predation were about 100 times greater in Lake Erie than in Lake Superior. Biomass-specific consumption (C:B) ratios per age-class in Lake Michigan were highest for rainbow smelt of ages 0 and 1 (14.64 and 9.00) and lowest for ages 4 and 5 (4.60 and 4.54). Production was concentrated in the first three age-classes in all the lakes and ages 0 and 1 accounted for about 87\% of the total production in Lake Erie. Population {GCE} was highest in Lake Erie (20.4\%) and lowest in Lake Ontario (15.6\%). Production: biomass (P:B) ratios varied from 1.54 in Lake Erie to 1.10 in Lake Ontario. The highest P:B ratio for any age-class was 2.97 for age-0 rainbow smelt in Lake Erie and the lowest was 0.29 for age-4 fish in Lake Huron. Simulations indicated that rainbow smelt biomass is concentrated in age-classes that may be thermally segregated from salmonine predators and that increased mortality of older smelt age-classes can reduce predation by smelt on other fishes.

the model, when consumption was constrained by fixed growth, were quite insensitive to perturbation
of all parameters except the energy density of prey. We computed consumption rates and
energy budgets with the model and compared these with independently derived estimates for
populations in Lake Dalncc. {USSR}: Lake Washington, {USA}; and Babine Lake, Canada. The close
agreement of estimates from the model to independent estimates of prey consumption and energybudgets

Predictions of modeled predation rate on salmonids were compared with field data from three areas of John Day Reservoir (Columbia River). To make bioenergetics model estimates of predation rate, three methods were used to approximate the change in mass of average predators during 30-d growth periods: observed change in mass between the first and the second month, predicted change in mass calculated with seasonal growth rates, and predicted change in mass based on an annual growth model. For all reservoir areas combined, bioenergetics model predictions of predation on salmon were 19\% lower than field estimates based on observed masses, 45\% lower than estimates based on seasonal growth rates, and 15\% lower than estimates based on the annual growth model. For each growth approach, the largest differences in field-versus-model predation occurred at the midreservoir area (-84\% to -67\% difference). Model predictions of the rate of predation on salmonids were examined for sensitivity to parameter variation, swimming speed, sampling bias caused by gear selectivity, and asymmetric size distributions of predators. The specific daily growth rate of northern pikeminnow predicted by the model was highest in July and October and decreased during August. The bioenergetics model for northern pikeminnow performed well compared with models for other fish species that have been tested with field data. This model should be a useful tool for evaluating management actions such as predator removal, examining the influence of temperature on predation rates, and exploring interactions between predators in the Columbia River basin.},

Study objectives were (1) to determine the relative effect of temperature versus food consumption on model-predicted growth and (2) to identify relationships between model-predicted food consumption and commonly measured environmental variables. A bioenergetics model for rainbow trout was calibrated to apparent age-1 growth in summer and fall–spring periods for 10 years at eight Sierra Nevada, California, study sites. Model analyses showed that the observed year-to-year variation in summer growth was related to food consumption but not to temperature and that temperature was more important, but still of secondary importance, to observed variation in fall–spring growth. Growth at all sampling sites appeared lower and more variable in summer than in other seasons, and variation among sites and years in the food consumption parameter P (determined by fitting the model to observed apparent growth) was highly related to environmental variables during fall–spring but not during summer. During fall–spring, 80\% of the variation in P was explained by a linear regression model that included temperature, flow, and trout density. Summer P-values were only weakly related to stream gradient. Our data and analysis indicate that (1) when not extreme, temperatures in summer may have less effect on growth than during other seasons and (2) growth is more affected by factors controlling food consumption (including indirect effects of temperature) than by the direct effects of temperature. © 1999 Taylor \& Francis Group, {LLC}.},

The model was composed of three ocean domains, which corresponded to the Kuroshio, the Oyashio, and the interfrontal zone (mixed water) regions. In these three domains, a lower trophic model ({NEMURO}) was coupled with a simple physical model, and the time-variation of three zooplankton size classes was input as prey densities into the saury bioenergetics model. Three numerical experiments were examined using this model, which corresponded to three different spawning seasons. Results showed that in the first year winter-spawned saury showed the fastest growth, and spring-spawned showed the slowest growth, while in the second year (time to grow to 120 g wet weight), the reverse occurred, i.e., spring-spawned saury showed the fastest growth. This difference in growth, which depends on the spawning season, can explain the bimodal size distribution of early autumn catch data. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Modeling of a 4°C increase in water temperatures due to climate warming suggested increases in growth in the northern parts of the species’ natural range and declines or extirpation in the south.

Washington, Kokanee, the landlocked form of sockeye salmon, dominated the limnetic planktivore fish community, potentially creating greater intraspecific than interspecific competition. However, bioenergetic simulations and cladoceran egg-ratio analysis indicated that consumption demand by adult and juvenile kokanees and juvenile sockeye salmon could be satisfied by less than 1\% of the instantaneous production of the preferred large Daphnia pulicaria throughout the growing season. Juvenile kokanees and sockeye salmon represented 72\% of the annual diet by volume of large ( less than or equal to 300-mm fork length), limnetic northern squawfish Ptychocheilus oregonensis during winter-summer. Forty percent of the diet of large ( less than or equal to 300-mm fork length), limnetic cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki consisted of age-0 and age-1 O. nerka (40-140 mm fork length) during spring and summer. The per-capita predation by cutthroat trout on juvenile salmonids was 25 times greater than predation by northern squawfish. Simulations indicated that 138,900 age-0 O. nerka (17.4\% of the estimated fry production) were eaten for every 1,000 large cutthroat trout in the lake, whereas only 5,600 age-0 fish (0.7\% of the fry production) were eaten per 1,000 large northern squawfish. Lower predation by northern squawfish was due to the small percentages (2-8\%) of these predators that inhabited the limnetic zone and interacted with age-0 age-1 O. nerka during spring and summer. We conclude that competitions is unlikely to limit O. nerka production, even with an intensive enhancement program. However, predation could undermine enhancement efforts if piscivore populations are sufficiently large; therefore, piscivore abundance must be assessed before total predation losses can be estimated.},

In particular, the function that dictates temperature dependence in maximum consumption (Cmax) within the Wisconsin bioenergetics model for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha produces estimates that are lower than those measured in published laboratory feeding trials. We used published and unpublished data from laboratory feeding trials with subyearling Chinook Salmon from three stocks (Snake, Nechako, and Big Qualicum rivers) to estimate and adjust the model parameters for temperature dependence in Cmax. The data included growth measures in fish ranging from 1.5 to 7.2 g that were held at temperatures from 14°C to 26°C. Parameters for temperature dependence in Cmax were estimated based on relative differences in food consumption, and bootstrapping techniques were then used to estimate the error about the parameters. We found that at temperatures between 17°C and 25°C, the current parameter values did not match the observed data, indicating that Cmax should be shifted by about 4°C relative to the current implementation under the bioenergetics model. We conclude that the adjusted parameters for Cmax should produce more accurate predictions from the bioenergetics model for subyearling Chinook Salmon.},

These species are currently imperilled in Mongolian waters, with Baikal grayling (Thymallus arcticus baicalensis) listed as near-threatened and lenok (Brachymystax lenok) listed as vulnerable on the Mongolian red list. Air temperature records demonstrate that in the last 40 years Northern Mongolia's rate of warming has been three times greater than the northern hemisphere average. Despite alarming trends in air temperatures, little is known of the thermal ecology of these species. Due to the threat of climate change to these species, the objective of our study was to quantify metabolic costs for these species from streamside routine metabolic measures and derive bioenergetics models that we used to assess potential climate change response. Streamside measurements of metabolism were remarkably consistent with expectations from measures of other salmonids gathered under more closely controlled laboratory conditions. Metabolism increased exponentially with temperature for both species. The resulting preliminary bioenergetics models suggest these species are already experiencing temperatures near their upper levels for growth during summer and conditions are expected to deteriorate with warming. Even a modest 2 °C increase in water temperatures during ice out would result in a 59\% reduction in growth of lenok, and an inability of Baikal grayling to grow (if food levels remained unchanged) or a 14–23\% increase in consumption in order to maintain current growth rates.},

A coupled foraging and bioenergetics model was developed to predict the dependency of menhaden size on chlorophyll a (chl a) and water temperatures in the bay. Substantial improvements were made to functional responses previously developed to describe {YOY} menhaden filtering efficiency on phytoplankton and swimming speed while filter feeding. Model output was calibrated to correspond to observed lengths of field-collected menhaden over an 11 yr period (1995 to 2005) by adjusting the percentage of chl a available to menhaden in the model. The model effectively represents variability in menhaden length in response to changes in chl a and temperature, indicating that only 9.2\% of available chl a was required for menhaden to grow to lengths observed in the bay. In simulations of growth potential by bay region, the oligohaline (upper) region had the highest growth potential with decreasing potential in the mesohaline (middle) and polyhaline (lower) regions of the bay. Our results represent the first rigorous calibration and evaluation of a coupled foraging-bioenergetics model for Atlantic menhaden and establish a quantitative link between chl a standing stock and menhaden growth potential. © Inter-Research 2011.},

	abstract = {Researchers have long recognized the importance of ecological differences at the species level in structuring natural communities yet until recently have often overlooked the influence of intraspecific trait variation, which can profoundly alter community dynamics [1]. Human extraction of living resources can reduce intraspecific trait variation by, for example, causing truncation of age and size structure of populations, where numbers of older individuals decline far more with exploitation than younger individuals. Age truncation can negatively affect population and community stability, increasing variability in population and community biomass [2–6], reducing productivity [7–10] and life-history diversity in traits such as the spatial and temporal pattern of reproduction and migration [4, 11–16]. Here, we quantified the extent of age truncation in 63 fished populations across five ocean regions, as measured by how much the proportions of fish in the oldest age groups declined over time. The proportion of individuals in the oldest age classes decreased significantly in 79\% to 97\% of populations (compared to historical or unfished values, respectively), and the magnitude of decline was greater than 90\% in 32\% to 41\% of populations. The pervasiveness and intensity of age truncation indicates that fishing is likely reducing the stability of many marine communities. Our findings suggest that more emphasis should be given to management measures that reduce the impact of fishing on age truncation, including no-take areas, slot limits that prohibit fishing on all except a narrow range of fish sizes, and rotational harvesting. Barnett et al. show that age truncation is prevalent and often severe in exploited marine fish populations. These changes in age structure likely reduce trait diversity and thus may reduce stability of fish populations and marine communities.},

	abstract = {Small-scale indigenous abalone fisheries on the northwest coast of Canada persisted for at least two millennia prior to modern commercial and recreational fisheries that lasted for four decades before collapsing, causing a coast wide closure that remains today. What traditional governance and stewardship practices fostered resilient fisheries along Canada's northwest coast and how might they inform collaborative institutions that foster ecologically sustainable and socially just coastal fisheries in future? In collaboration with two coastal First Nations, a policy analysis of northern abalone ({GaalGuuhlkyan} (Skidegate Haida), ǧaɫǧṇ̓íq̓ (Heiltsuk), Haliotis kamtschatkana) stewardship was conducted to assess where traditional and modern fisheries governance and management aligned or failed to align with seven theoretical principles of social-ecological resilience. The analysis revealed that traditional principles of reciprocity and contingent proprietorship of clan-based fishing areas aligned with resilience principles whereas contemporary centralized decision-making and region-wide management policies did not. Moreover, current issues of power asymmetry and lack of trust need to be addressed to build a future indigenous-state governance approach to coastal fisheries. This research demonstrates how indigenous resource governance and stewardship practices generated over millennia of social learning and experimentation offer insights that could be broadly applied to foster resilient coastal fisheries today.},

	abstract = {The consistent supply of fresh fish to commercial markets may mask growing fishing footprints and localized depletions, as fishing expands to deeper/further reefs, smaller fish, and more resilient species. To test this hypothesis, species-based records and fisher interviews were gathered over one year within a large, demand-driven coral-reef fishery in Chuuk, Micronesia. We first assessed catch statistics with respect to high windspeeds and moon phases that are known to constrain both catch and effort. While lower daily catch success was predicted by higher windspeeds and greater lunar illumination, total daily landings fluctuated less than fishing success across environmental gradients. Instead, daily landings were mainly driven by the number of flights from Chuuk to Guam (i.e., international demand). Given that demand masked local drivers of overall catch volume, we further evaluated species-based indicators of fisheries exploitation. Most target species (75\%) had either a positively skewed size distribution or proportional contributions that were dependent upon favorable conditions (i.e. season and moon phases). Skewed size distributions indicated truncated growth associated with fishing mortality, and in turn, suggested that size-based management policies may be most effective for these species. In contrast, environmentally-constrained catch success indicated species that may be more susceptible to growing fishing footprints and may respond better to gear/quota/area policies compared to size policies. Species-based responses offered a simplified means to combine species into fisheries management units. Finally, a comparison of commercial and subsistence landings showed higher vulnerability to fishing among species preferentially targeted by commercial fisheries, offering new insights into how commercial harvesting can disproportionately impact resources, despite having lower annual catch volumes.},

	abstract = {Indigenous people harvest wild species for food and cultural practice, fundamentally linking biodiversity conservation and indigenous rights. Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) are culturally significant to indigenous people (or First Nations) of coastal British Columbia ({BC}), Canada, who regulate their harvest under traditional governance structures. First Nations elders, however, have observed a decline in the body sizes and abundance of rockfishes, which coincides with increased exploitation by non-indigenous fishers. Rockfishes are vulnerable to overexploitation because fecundity and offspring quality increase with maternal size or age, yet fisheries truncate size and age structure. During 2006, 2007 and 2013–2015, we worked with the Wuikinuxv, Nuxalk, Heiltsuk and Kitasoo/Xai'Xais First Nations of {BC}'s Central Coast, examining rockfish population characteristics at 282 of their fishing sites. We used hook-and-line gear to collect fishery independent data, and sampled landings from First Nations subsistence fishers. Spatial fishery closures served as experimental treatments. We also applied central place foraging theory to predict declines in size, age and abundance with increasing distance from recreational fishing lodges and other ports. Analyses used linear mixed models and controlled for environmental variables. Our results suggest that spatial closures for commercial and recreational fishers led to greater size and abundance of some, but not all rockfishes, possibly due to interspecific differences in the extent to which closures contain suitable habitat, effects of non-compliance, or other factors. Notably, Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), a species key to indigenous diets, were 21\% larger inside than outside spatial closures. Possibly reflecting cumulative fishery exploitation, however, old-aged Yelloweye Rockfish were rare. Fishery impacts on size and relative abundance decreased at sites that required longer travel times and greater fuel costs for recreational fishers to exploit, but only for the longest-lived species (size responses) and for long-lived species analysed in aggregate (abundance responses). Measures for protecting indigenous access to rockfishes include evaluation of habitat suitability and compliance within spatial closures, improved understanding of recreational fishery impacts, and treating old-age and large size structures as explicit management objectives. Our study contributes to a global effort to integrate indigenous cultural values with biological conservation.},

Coincident with recent exceptional warming of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and removal of large predatory fish, the American lobster has become the most valuable fishery resource in North America. Using a model that links ocean temperature, predator density, and fishing to population productivity, we show that harvester-driven conservation efforts to protect large lobsters prepared the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery to capitalize on favorable ecosystem conditions, resulting in the record-breaking landings recently observed in the region. In contrast, in the warmer southern New England region, the absence of similar conservation efforts precipitated warming-induced recruitment failure that led to the collapse of the fishery. Population projections under expected warming suggest that the American lobster fishery is vulnerable to future temperature increases, but continued efforts to preserve the stock’s reproductive potential can dampen the negative impacts of warming. This study demonstrates that, even though global climate change is severely impacting marine ecosystems, widely adopted, proactive conservation measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate change.},

The main species captured by these fisheries are deep-water snappers (Lutjanidae), groupers (Epinephelidae), and emperors (Lethrinidae). Quantitative assessments of deep-water tropical fisheries have been limited by a lack of adequate biological and fisheries data. We review the biology and ecology of deep-water tropical fishes, discuss the implications for assessment and management of tropical deep-water fisheries, and provide perspectives on future research priorities. We found that biological and fisheries information is lacking for the majority of deep-water tropical fishes. Furthermore, many studies were constrained by low samples sizes and the use of methods that have not been validated or verified. Most species for which reliable information was available were reported to have extended longevities ({\textgreater}20 years), low rates of natural mortality (M {\textless} 0.15), and slow to modest growth rates (K = 0.12–0.25). These life history traits indicate a low production potential for many deep-water tropical fishes, and suggest that sustainable exploitation rates and potential yields may be low. There is a need for more representative and adequate studies of deep-water tropical fishes and for improved fisheries data collection and the use of consistent methods in addition to information sharing to facilitate the development of robust data-poor assessment techniques for these species.},

	abstract = {Marine fisheries contribute to the global economy, from the catching of fish through to the provision of support services for the fishing industry. General lack of data and uncertainty about the level of employment in marine fisheries can lead to underestimation of fishing effort and hence over-exploited fisheries, or result in inaccurate projections of economic and societal costs and benefits. To address this gap, a database of marine fisheries employment for 144 coastal nations was compiled. Gaps in employment data that emerged were filled using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the number of direct and indirect fisheries jobs. We focused on estimating jobs in the small-scale fishing sector. We characterized small-scale fishing as (i) primarily geared towards household consumption or sale at the local level; (ii) conducted at a low level of economic activity; (iii) minimally mechanized; (iv) conducted within inshore areas; (v) minimally managed; and/or (vi) undertaken for cultural or ceremonial purposes. In total, we estimated that 260±6million people are involved in global marine fisheries, encompassing full-time and part-time jobs in the direct and indirect sectors, with 22±0.45million of those being small-scale fishers. This is equivalent to 203±34million full-time equivalent jobs. Study results can be used to improve management decision making and highlight the need to improve monitoring and reporting of the number of people employed in marine fisheries globally. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2664.13535},
	abstract = {Ecosystems at high latitudes are exposed to some of the highest rates of climate warming on earth, and freshwater ecosystems in those regions are already experiencing extended ice-free seasons and warmer waters. The dominant fish species in these ecosystems are cold-water salmonids, which play a central ecological role in lake ecosystems, where they are often exposed to size-selective fisheries that truncate their size and age distributions, making them potentially vulnerable to exploitation and environmental perturbations. Here, we address the combined effects of climate-induced water temperature increase (using regionally downscaled climate models based on the {RCP}-4.5 and {RCP}-8.5 climate scenarios together with an air-to-water temperature model) and gillnet harvesting, over the period from 1950 to 2100, on the somatic growth, demography and vulnerability of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.), using an eco-genetic individual-based model. The model captures successive annual life-history events, including the key processes of size-dependent mortality, age- and size-dependent maturation described by a probabilistic reaction norm, temperature-dependent growth, size-dependent reproduction and density-dependent recruitment. Our model predicts that higher water temperatures will increase the somatic growth of Arctic charr, leading to larger body size at age and increased stock biomass: for {RCP}-8.5, we predict an 80\% increase in stock biomass in the year 2100 relative to the year 2000 in the absence of fishing. Interestingly, this potential increase in biomass in future climate scenarios will be partially masked by harvesting: for a fishing mortality of 0.3 year−1, we predict a mere 40\% increase in stock biomass in 2100 relative to 2000. Despite the predicted increase in stock biomass, yield will increase substantially only when fishing mortality is low. In addition, climate warming will accentuate the age-truncation effect of harvesting, which will target younger individuals, including immatures, thus elevating the vulnerability of the population to environmental perturbations. Synthesis and applications. Our model-based analyses highlight the combined effects of climate change and size-selective fishing, emphasizing the emerging vulnerability of fish populations to multiple stressors. We recommend carefully climate-adapted management strategies permitting only a narrow range of gillnet mesh sizes for inland fisheries at high latitudes.},

In particular, it has been proposed that age truncation induced by fisheries exploitation may increase the population's sensitivity to climate. In this study, we use unique long-term abundance data for the Northeast Arctic stock of cod (Gadus morhua) and the Norwegian Spring-Spawning stock of herring (Clupea harengus), which we analyze using techniques based on age-structured population matrices. After identifying time periods with different age distributions in the spawning stock, we use linear models to quantify the relative effect of exploitation and temperature on the population growth rates. For the two populations, age truncation was found to be associated with an increasing importance of temperature and a relatively decreasing importance of exploitation, while the population growth rate became increasingly sensitive to recruitment variations. The results suggested that the removal of older age classes reduced the buffering capacity of the population, thereby making the population growth rate more dependent on recruitment than adult survival and increasing the effect of environmental fluctuations. Age structure appeared as a key characteristic that can affect the response of fish stocks to climate variations and its consequences may be of key importance for conservation and management. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Intensive size-selective harvesting can drive evolution of sexual maturity at smaller body size. Conversely, prehistoric, low-intensity subsistence harvesting is not considered an effective agent of size-selective evolution. Uniting archaeological, palaeontological and contemporary material, we show that size at sexual maturity in the edible conch Strombus pugilis declined significantly from pre-human (approx. 7 ka) to prehistoric times (approx. 1 ka) and again to the present day. Size atmaturity also fell fromearly- to late-prehistoric periods, synchronous with an increase in harvesting intensity as other resources became depleted. A consequence of declining size at maturity is that early prehistoric harvesters would have received two-thirds more meat per conch than contemporary harvesters. After exploring the potential effects of selection biases, demographic shifts, environmental change and habitat alteration, these observations collectively implicate prehistoric subsistence harvesting as an agent of size-selective evolution with long-term detrimental consequences. We observe that contemporary populations that are protected from harvesting are slightly larger at maturity, suggesting that halting or even reversing thousands of years of size-selective evolution may be possible. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Growing experimental evidence, modeling studies, and field observations have revealed that common responses to harvest include changes in life-history and behavioral traits, which have the potential to reshape the ecology of harvested systems. On the basis of existing evidence, we propose a set of general mechanisms that link harvest-driven trait changes to ecological processes, including trophic cascades, nutrient dynamics, keystone interactions, ecosystem stability, and habitat use. Managing harvested ecosystems sustainably may require strategies that account for harvest-driven trait changes.

The North American literature on the subject is heavily influenced by a focus on Arctic indigenous populations emphasizing cultural survival. Ultimately, subsistence can be a matter of survival in the belly, the soul, or both.

proportionately more immature alewives and other prey. Diets of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) did not change

inhibited by insufficient forage available to them. A simulation of chinook salmon feeding on bloater (Coregonus

	abstract = {Parameters derived from laboratory experiments that separately measured the routine metabolic rates (respiration) and swimming speeds of young-of-the-year (age-0) alewives Alosa pseudoharengus were compared with values published for a bioenergetics model for adults. Respiration rates of age-0 alewives were significantly influenced by water temperature and scaled isometrically with weight (range, 0.0001-1 g). Swimming speed was strongly related to fish weight and, unlike for adult alewives, water temperature significantly influenced the swimming speeds of age-0 fish. Temperature coefficients, along with the slopes for the weight dependence of age-0 alewife respiration rates and swimming speeds, significantly differed by 51-709\% from published parameters for adults. Using adult parameters, the standard respiration rates at 15-25°C of age-0 alewives weighing less than 0.02 g were overestimated by 7-88\% and the swimming speeds for fish weighing less than 1.0 g were overestimated by 130-4,270\%. Application of our age-0 alewife swimming speed parameters in the exponential activity function used in the adult bioenergetics model resulted in no activity costs for age-0 fish smaller than 0.2 g, which is clearly unrealistic. Because no data relating respiration to activity level (i.e., concurrent measurements of respiration and swimming speed) currently exist for age-0 alewives, we recommend using routine respiration rates without an activity multiplier to represent the costs of normal activity in the field. All parameters derived in this study for age-0 alewives differed from those of adults by more than 10\%, a deviation commonly used in sensitivity analyses of bioenergetics models, which indicated that application of adult parameters to early life stages was not warranted. Use of metabolism-weight relations from the literature derived for multiple species also are not recommended because the estimated routine metabolic rates of age-0 alewives differed by 2-311\% from rates measured in this study.},

	abstract = {Small aspen stands are disappearing from the landscape in the Southwest, so it is important to understand their contribution to the avian community. We sampled birds in 53 small, isolated aspen stands and 53 paired plots within the ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona, during the 1996 and 1997 breeding seasons. Bird species richness and abundance were higher in aspen than in pine. However, bird species richness and abundance did not vary with size of the aspen patch or isolation index. In addition, direct ordination of species distributions with habitat factors suggested no distinct avian communities. This suggests that aspen stands do not harbor separate populations, but rather are locations where the regional avifauna reaches high local density and richness and may be crucial to birds in years of resource scarcity. Thus it is important for avian conservation to maintain many aspen stands across the landscape, encompassing a diversity of vegetation structure and composition. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We developed a bioenergetics model for subadult and adult smallmouth bass and compared the abilities of the two models to predict growth and food consumption for fish weighing from 100 to 270 g. Model-independent laboratory growth and food consumption data for individual subadult and adult fish were used to evaluate the performance of both models. Experimental fish were subjected to three consecutive 3-week feeding regimes: an ad libitum ration at 22degreesC, a ration of 2.5\% wet body weight/d at 22degreesC, and a ration of 2\% wet body weight/d at 27degreesC. Overall, the bioenergetics model developed for subadult/adult smallmouth bass produced significantly greater accuracy in estimates of relative growth rate and cumulative consumption for subadult and adult fish than did the age-0 model. The subadult-adult model tracked observed changes in mean fish weight more closely than did the model developed for age-0 fish, and the mean percentage errors in predicting cumulative consumption were consistently lower for the subadult-adult model. Our findings are consistent with previous studies, which have also found that bioenergetics models developed for a particular life stage of a species can yield substantially inaccurate predictions of growth and consumption for other life stages of that species. The model developed for subadult and adult fish produced better agreement with observed growth and food consumption by subadult and adult smallmouth bass than the model developed for age-0 fish and is recommended for applications involving fish weighing more than 50 g.},

	abstract = {The feeding activity of warm- and coolwater fishes can be severely restricted during the long period of cold temperatures characteristic of winter in temperate zone lakes and rivers. The effect of such restriction is greater for smaller fish. Weight-specific basal metabolism increases as size decreases; however, there is no corresponding increase in energy storage capacity. Thus, smaller fish tend to be less tolerant of starvation conditions because they exhaust their energy stores sooner. Such size dependence of starvation endurance has often been observed in laboratory experiments. In wild populations commonly subject to winter starvation, population viability hinges on the ability of young of year to complete a minimum amount of growth during their first year of life. From south to north, this ability is increasingly restricted as the growing season shortens and the starvation period lengthens. We show that this constraint is sufficient to explain the present locations of the northern distributional limit for yellow perch Perca flavescens in central and western North America, the northern distributional limit for Eurasian perch P. fluviatilis in Eurasia, and the northern distributional limit for smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieui in central North America. We also forecast how shifts in North American climate may relax this constraint and permit both yellow perch and smallmouth bass to thrive well to the north of their present distributions.},

We applied a combined telemetry and tag-return design to southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), a coastal flatfish that demonstrates limited movements within estuarine habitats coupled with extensive ontogenetic migrations that present unique challenges for estimating mortality rates. The fates of acoustically and conventionally tagged fish were followed during 2014–2016 to estimate annual rates of fishing mortality (F), natural mortality (M), and estuarine emigration (E). Multistate models estimated southern flounder annual F for each of the 3 years at two spatial scales (New River estuary F = 0.49–1.61; North Carolina coast F = 0.36–0.72). Annual rates of emigration were high (E = 1.06–1.67), and direct estimation of this source of loss considerably improved mortality estimates. The model estimated natural mortality as a constant annual rate (M = 0.84), which was similar in magnitude to life-history-based estimates for similar age groups. By accounting for unique behavioral attributes in the study design, the application of multistate tagging models provided robust estimates of mortality and emigration rates for a valuable coastal fishery resource that will inform future efforts to achieve yield and conservation goals.},

An approach for identifying and correcting this error is demonstrated with a white crappie (Pomoxis annularis) {BEM}. Model-predicted trajectories of growth and cumulative consumption for 39 individual white crappie obtained from six 60-day laboratory experiments diverged from observed values by up to 42.5\% and 227\%, respectively, indicating systematic error in the {BEM}. To evaluate correlates of the systematic error, model prediction errors were regressed against three major input/output variables of {BEMs} that were covered by the laboratory experiments: fish body weight (80-341 g), temperature (23-30 °C), and consumption level (0.5\%-6.2\% daily). Consumption level explained {\textgreater}80\% of the prediction error for growth and consumption. Two multiple regression equations containing body weight, temperature, and consumption variables were developed to estimate growth prediction error (R2 = 0.96) and consumption prediction error (R 2 = 0.86), and incorporated into the white crappie {BEM} to correct its predictions. Cross-validation indicated that growth and consumption prediction error was reduced 2- to 4-fold by correction. Given recent evidence of widespread systematic error and increasing application rates of {BEMs}, the efficient error-identification and -correction approach described appears broadly applicable and timely. © 2004 {NRC} Canada.},

	abstract = {We developed a bioenergetics model for the western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis by combining data on temperature-dependent feeding rates with published information on respiration, temperature tolerance, and reproduction. To corroborate the model, we compared bioenergetics estimates with independent observations from laboratory feeding and growth trials. The model was then applied to a western mosquitofish population in Illinois to estimate feeding rates on natural prey taxa, including mosquito (Culicidae) larvae. Laboratory feeding experiments revealed that western mosquitofish have a high feeding capacity. Maximum consumption rates were 0.25-1.06 g(.)g(-1.)d(-1) at water temperatures between 5degreesC and 40degreesC; the highest feeding rates were observed at 32degreesC. Bioenergetics estimates of food consumption agreed well with laboratory measurements across a wide range of water temperatures (10-35degreesC). However, for fish experiencing negligible growth, model estimates of food consumption were higher than actual values measured in the laboratory. We postulate that at very low feeding and growth rates, activity costs may be overestimated by the model. Field-derived bioenergetics estimates of total food consumption ranged from 0.18 to 0.31 g of dry weight and were similar to those obtained from an empirical model relating western mosquitofish feeding and growth rates (0.15-0.39 g dry weight). Based on model simulations, we estimated that a typical age-0 western mosquitofish consumed about 1.990 mosquito larvae (2-68 larvae/d) from August 22 to October 8, 1998. Because the diets of free-ranging western mosquitofish were diverse, field-based estimates of mosquito consumption were generally lower than those reported for laboratory experiments, in which fish were fed only mosquito larvae. By accounting for diet composition in free-ranging western mosquitofish, the bioenergetics approach provides more realistic estimates of mosquito consumption than laboratory feeding experiments. Given recent concerns over the spread of West Nile virus, the model developed here should prove useful for quantifying western mosquitofish consumption in the context of both mosquito control and potential impacts on nontarget organisms.},

limited. To investigate the highly dynamic nature of meroplankton, we sampled the zooplankton community in a
high-Arctic fjord in West-Spitsbergen bi-weekly from December 2011 to December 2012. Five significantly different
seasonal meroplankton assemblages were identified, representing winter, early spring, spring, summer and autumn.
Meroplankton persistently dominated the zooplankton community during the productive seasons in both abundance
(41–91\%) and biomass (54–98\%). Cirripedia and Bivalvia larvae occurred in particularly high numbers and dominated
during spring and summer respectively. In the remaining seasons, the meroplankton diversity and abundance
were comparatively poor, but interestingly Bryozoa larvae were present mainly during winter. Chlorophyll a and day
length were identified as the main environmental variables structuring the meroplankton assemblage, followed by
hydrography. Timing of the spring bloom determined the onset of the “meroplankton-boost” and from the observed
hydrography, local rather than advective processes shaped the meroplankton community. Our investigation suggests
that benthic invertebrate larvae play a significant role in the pelagic ecosystems in Arctic coastal regions, tightly
linking the pelagic and benthic realms, thus deserving more attention in future studies.},

Model-predicted consumption was within 5.5 ± 10.9\% of observed values for larger fish and within 12.4 ± 16.0\% for smaller fish. Our model should be useful to those dealing with issues currently faced by Bull Trout, such as climate change or alterations in prey availability. © American Fisheries Society 2013.},

	abstract = {Stream size interacted with mean July air temperature to influence the distribution of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in southeastern Wyoming streams. The geographic range of brown trout was positively associated with mean July air temperatures of 19-22°C. Within this thermal zone, brown trout were more likely to occur in large streams ({\textgreater}4 m wetted width) than in small streams. We used a geographic information system to examine spatial patterns in the distribution of anomalous sites (i.e., sites predicted to have brown trout but which lacked this species). Sites that lacked brown trout but contained brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) tended to be on small streams at the cold margin of the 19-22°C thermal window. Sites lacking both brown trout and brook trout tended to be on small streams clustered in three of the six study drainages. The spatial aggregation of these sites suggests that additional regional factors influence the occurrence of brown trout in southeastern Wyoming. It is hypothesized that these factors could involve land-use practices interacting with basin geology and geomorphology. Classification models that incorporate a few general habitat factors are useful for identifying stream reaches with the potential to support brown trout and for directing management efforts to sites where this potential is not realized.},

Water content (inversely correlated with energy density) of nonspawning Lake Michigan bloaters decreased linearly with increasing weight for fish smaller than 155 g. Model results indicated comparatively small seasonal changes in consumption, a result of high consumption by bloaters at low temperatures and relatively small differences in the temperatures of occupied water between winter and summer. Growth rates and food conversion efficiencies of bloater estimated from the model were higher by factors of 2-4 than comparable values for the alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, indicating that Lake Michigan could support a higher biomass of native coregonines than of the introduced alewife. Bioenergetics estimates of annual consumption of Diporeia hoyi and Mysis relicta by both bloaters and alewives more than doubled between 1973-1975, when alewife dominated, and 1987, when bloater dominated. This increase was most evident in the winter, when bloater feeding rates were relatively high, and during summer, when alewives fed primarily on zooplankton. © 1994 by the American Fisheries Society.},

Under the long-term impact of high predation pressure by piscivorous fish, a very heterogeneous population structure of roach had developed. Only a few age classes were dominant while other age classes were nearly absent. The proportion of males decreased with increasing age to 4\% of the total abundance of one age class, which nevertheless seemed to have no negative effect on reproductive success. Food analysis revealed that the diet consisted of a high proportion of algae and macrophytes. The collapse of the Daphnia galeata population in early summer 1998 forced the roach to switch to benthic food resources [macroinvertebrates and fish: Chironomids, molluscs and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus)] in early June. Total consumption of age-2 and age-4 roach, the two most dominant year classes, was calculated by a bioenergetics model. Additionally, consumption of age-0 roach was estimated by assuming a fixed daily food consumption rate. The results suggest that daily consumption by these age groups, which never exceeded 0.2\% of total biomass of the D. galeata population, had a negligible impact on the population of daphnids in Bautzen Reservoir during the period studied.},

Regression models developed for these species emphasized the influence of year- class strength on older age-classes, year-class strength being positively related to spawner abundance for both species and negatively related to high spring streamflow conditions for brown trout. Age-class density was also positively associated with high levels of large woody debris ({LWD}) in streams. Annual growth increments of brown trout and brook trout were often negatively related to increased age-class density and {LWD} and positively affected by elevated total phosphorus levels, cool summers, and warm winters. Annual survival of trout from age 0 to age 4 was negatively related to intra- and interspecific age-class density, and in three of seven models, positively associated with levels of {LWD}.

We examined the export of invertebrates (aquatic and terrestrial) and coarse organic detritus from forested headwaters to aquatic habitats downstream in the coastal mountains of southeast Alaska, U.S.A. Fifty-two small streams (mean discharge range: 1.2-3.6 L s-1), representing a geographic range throughout southeast Alaska, were sampled with 250-μm nets either seasonally (April, July, September) or every 2 weeks throughout the year. Samples were used to assess the potential subsidy of energy from fishless headwaters to downstream systems containing fish. 2. Invertebrates of aquatic and terrestrial origin were both captured, with aquatic taxa making up 65-92\% of the total. Baetidae, Chironomidae and Ostracoda were most numerous of the aquatic taxa (34, 16 and 8\%, respectively), although Coleoptera (mostly Amphizoidae) contributed the greatest biomass (30\%). Mites (Acarina) were the most numerous terrestrial taxon, while terrestrial Coleoptera accounted for most of the terrestrial invertebrate biomass. 3. Invertebrates and detritus were exported from headwaters throughout the year, averaging 163 mg invertebrate dry mass stream-1 day-1 and 10.4 g detritus stream-1 day-1, respectively. The amount of export was highly variable among streams and seasons (5-6000 individuals stream-1 day-1 and {\textless}1-22 individuals m-3 water; {\textless}1-286 g detritus stream-1 day-1 and {\textless}0.1-1.7 g detritus m-3 water). Delivery of invertebrates from headwaters to habitats with fish was estimated at 0.44 g dry mass m-2 year-1. We estimate that every kilometre of salmonid-bearing stream could receive enough energy (prey and detritus) from fishless headwaters to support 100-2000 young-of-the-year ({YOY}) salmonids. These results illustrate that headwaters are source areas of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates and detritus, linking upland ecosystems with habitats lower in the catchment.},

Whether analogous behaviors exploit horizontal habitat heterogeneity in streams is largely unknown. We investigated fish movement behavior at daily timescales to explore how individuals integrated across spatial variation in food abundance and water temperature. Juvenile coho salmon made feeding forays into cold habitats with abundant food, and then moved long distances (350-1300 m) to warmer habitats that accelerated their metabolism and increased their assimilative capacity. This behavioral thermoregulation enabled fish to mitigate trade-offs between trophic and thermal resources by exploiting thermal heterogeneity. Fish that exploited thermal heterogeneity grew at substantially faster rates than did individuals that assumed other behaviors. Our results provide empirical support for the importance of thermal diversity in lotic systems, and emphasize the importance of considering interactions between animal behavior and habitat heterogeneity when managing and restoring ecosystems. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	abstract = {Competition between brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo truttta) was studied by measuring characteristics of daytime positions held by brook trout before and after removal of the brown trout from 1800 m of a stream. We used four criteria as indices of position quality: "water velocity difference" (the difference between velocity at the focal point and in the fastest current within 60 cm of the fish), water depth, distance to stream bed, and lighting. After brown trout removal, brook trout larger than 15 cm chose resting positions with more favorable water velocity characteristics and more often in shade. The position shift was greatest for the largest brook trout, those of 20–30 cm. Feeding positions of brook trout changed little upon brown trout removal according to our criteria. The shift in resting positions of brook trout after release from competition with brown trout indicates that brown trout excluded brook trout from preferred resting positions, a critical and scarce resource. The combined effects of such interspecific competition, differential susceptibility to angling, differential response to environmental factors, and predation of brown trout on juvenile brook trout may account for declines of brook trout populations while brown trout populations expand in many streams of the northeastern United States where the two species are sympatric.Key words: brook trout, brown trout, competition, ecological release, microhabitat use, resting positions, feeding positions, stream, Michigan},

Theoretical models suggest short-term responses to a single pulse can qualitatively differ from longer-term responses. Recurrent resource pulses can alter community structure, permitting coexistence that otherwise would not occur, or hamper coexistence mechanisms effective in stable environments. For a given resource input, system responses can be more dramatic with short pulses. Resource pulses can cause transitions between alternative states. Dispersal permits species to exploit locally sporadic resource pulses and persist in environments that on average are unsuitable.

Large meals required a greater absolute investment of energy to process (a larger so-called specific dynamic action, {SDA}), but the percentage of digestible meal energy required in the {SDA} response ({SDA} coefficient) decreased with increasing meal size. Combined with the findings that growth rate and growth efficiency also increased with food intake, our results demonstrate that it is energetically advantageous for fish to select large prey. However, following a large meal, {SDA} processes occupied up to 77\% of the available {AS}, indicating that other oxygen-demanding activities like swimming may be compromised while large meals are processed. This trade-off between meal size and {AS} suggests that fishes like barramundi would benefit from regulating prey size based on imminent requirements and threats.},

	abstract = {Effective management of social-ecological systems ({SESs}) requires an understanding of human behavior. In many {SESs}, there are hundreds of agents or more interacting with governance and regulatory institutions, driving management outcomes through collective behavior. Agents in these systems often display consistent behavioral characteristics over time that can help reduce the dimensionality of {SES} data by enabling the assignment of types. Typologies of resource-user behavior both enrich our knowledge of user cultures and provide critical information for management. Here, we develop a data-driven framework to identify resource-user typologies in {SESs} with high-dimensional data. To demonstrate policy applications, we apply the framework to a tightly coupled {SES}, commercial fishing. We leverage large fisheries-dependent datasets that include mandatory vessel logbooks, observer datasets, and high-resolution geospatial vessel tracking technologies. We first quantify vessel and behavioral characteristics using data that encode fishers’ spatial decisions and behaviors. We then use clustering to classify these characteristics into discrete fishing behavioral types ({FBTs}), determining that 3 types emerge in our case study. Finally, we investigate how a series of disturbances applied selection pressure on these {FBTs}, causing the disproportionate loss of one group. Our framework not only provides an efficient and unbiased method for identifying {FBTs} in near real time, but it can also improve management outcomes by enabling ex ante investigation of the consequences of disturbances such as policy actions.},

	abstract = {Use of accelerometers is now widespread within animal biologging as they provide a means of measuring an animal's activity in a meaningful and quantitative way where direct observation is not possible. In sequential acceleration data, there is a natural dependence between observations of behaviour, a fact that has been largely ignored in most analyses. Analyses of acceleration data where serial dependence has been explicitly modelled have largely relied on hidden Markov models ({HMMs}). Depending on the aim of an analysis, an {HMM} can be used for state prediction or to make inferences about drivers of behaviour. For state prediction, a supervised learning approach can be applied. That is, an {HMM} is trained to classify unlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories. An unsupervised learning approach can be used to infer new aspects of animal behaviour when biologically meaningful response variables are used, with the caveat that the states may not map to specific behaviours. We provide the details necessary to implement and assess an {HMM} in both the supervised and unsupervised learning context and discuss the data requirements of each case. We outline two applications to marine and aerial systems (shark and eagle) taking the unsupervised learning approach, which is more readily applicable to animal activity measured in the field. {HMMs} were used to infer the effects of temporal, atmospheric and tidal inputs on animal behaviour. Animal accelerometer data allow ecologists to identify important correlates and drivers of animal activity (and hence behaviour). The {HMM} framework is well suited to deal with the main features commonly observed in accelerometer data and can easily be extended to suit a wide range of types of animal activity data. The ability to combine direct observations of animal activity with statistical models, which account for the features of accelerometer data, offers a new way to quantify animal behaviour and energetic expenditure and to deepen our insights into individual behaviour as a constituent of populations and ecosystems.},

	doi = {10.1242/jeb.027102},
	abstract = {To test the hypothesis that digestion has a more notable physiological effect on ambush foragers than on active foragers, we investigated the behavioural, digestive and metabolic characteristics, as well as the postprandial locomotory capacity, of four species of juvenile fish distributed along the Yangtze River, China, with distinct foraging strategies. The ambush foraging southern catfish (Silurus meridionlis) had the fewest movements per minute ({MPM}), lowest per cent time spent moving ({PTM}), slowest critical swimming speed (Ucrit), lowest maintenance metabolism (V̇ O2rest) and lowest maximum locomotory metabolism (V̇ O2max). However, the southern catfish had the highest feeding level and maximum feeding metabolism (V̇O2peak) and the greatest decrease in Ucrlt after consumption of a large meal. Thus, this fish is highly adapted to its ambush behavioural strategy and sedentary life style. In the herbivorous grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), a low digestive capacity led to little change in postprandial locomotory performance, which benefits its frequent grazing behaviour. In this species, the greater amount of energy spent on routine activity and avoiding predators versus Ucrit might be related to its herbivorous life style and high predation risk. The active foraging crucian carp (Carassius auratus) adopts a unique high energy cost strategy that allows for high capacity in both routine activity and digestion, and the great flexibility of its cardio-respiratory capacity (increased V̇o2max after feeding) guarantees a small decrease in Ucrlt even after maximum feeding. Finally, the sluggish foraging darkbarbel catfish (Pelteobagrus vachelli) has low digestive and locomotory capacity, but its energy-efficient venomous defence strategy may be related to its abundance. These results show that the digestive, behavioural and metabolic strategies differ among these fish species. The locomotory capacity in the sedentary fishes decreased profoundly after feeding, whereas it decreased little or not at all in the active fishes. The maintenance of high locomotory capacity after eating in the active fishes is probably related to a large metabolic capacity, a lower digestive capacity or an improvement in cardio-respiratory capacity after feeding.},

	abstract = {1. Determining how animals move within their environment is a fundamental knowledge that contributes to effective management and conservation. Continuous 'round-the-clock' animal movement data are frequently gathered using biotelemetry technology, providing discrete data packages on the presence-absence of animals at known locations through time. Current analyses of such data do not generally account for the interconnectivity of locations as animals move between them and consequently do not integrate graphically or statistically a temporal component to spatial changes. 2.Here, we describe the novel application of network analyses to electronic tag data whereby nodes represent locations and edges the movements of individuals. We demonstrate some of the descriptive and quantitative approaches for determining how an animal's movement interconnects home range habitats. Telemetry data from arrays of recorders provide movement data of individual animals, and as examples of the method proposed, we examine the movements of two distinct shark species, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi). In doing so, we consider both local and global network properties from an animal movement perspective and simulate the effects of node disruption as a proxy for habitat disturbance. 3.Comparative visual representations of two catshark movement networks suggest, for example, potential differences in space use. Multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure shows that habitat is a significant predictor of movement behaviour. 4.Null modelling of C. perezi movement data, corrected for the spatial restriction of static nodes, demonstrated a significant, non-random distribution of directed movements among sites. Additionally, the connectivity of this animal's movement network is significantly reduced through targeted disruption of a site of high centrality but not through disruption of a randomly selected site. 5.Network theory is a well-established theoretical framework and its integration into the fast developing field of animal movement and telemetry might improve significantly how we interpret animal space use from electronically recorded data. This technique has potentially wide application in animal behaviour but may also inform the management of habitat harbouring threatened or endangered species via the simulation, modelling and intuitive visualisation of animal movement interactions.

In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages’. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

It is the intention of this paper to encourage transparency and accuracy in future studies that measure the aerobic metabolism of fishes, and to highlight the fundamental issues with assuming broad relevance of the {OCLTT} hypothesis. © 2013.

	abstract = {Modeling animal movements is fundamental to animal ecology as it provides the foundation for further exploration into mechanisms affecting individual and population-level processes. In the last few decades, biotelemetry has enabled scientists to track the movements of marine life across a variety of scales. However, the use of such technology is progressing faster than the analytical techniques for modeling movement patterns. In summer 2012, we deployed an acoustic telemetry array around Culebra, Puerto Rico, consisting of 48 remote receivers that can detect coded transmissions sent by tags implanted in fish. We surgically implanted transmitters in bonefish ( n= 28), great barracuda ( n= 2) and permit ( n= 1) as part of a multi-year study. In January 2013, we downloaded over 850,000 detections from 39 receivers for 31 fish (several receivers had zero fish detections, and two receivers were not downloaded), and used that six-month data set to explore how graph theory and network analysis can be used to model the movement ecology of the tagged fish. We analyzed this data as two types of graphs. First, a bipartite graph was constructed by linking each fish with an edge weighted by the number of detections of that fish by that receiver. Bipartite graphs are not explicitly spatial, but rather represent which fish associate with which receivers. Second, spatial movement graphs for individuals were built by linking receivers (nodes) by edges with the number of times each fish moved along that edge as weights. The bipartite graph identified groups of fish visiting the same sites, and groups of sites visited by the same fish. Of the six community detection algorithms used, Multilevel, Fast-Greedy, and Walk-Trap performed best, with similar module partitions and modularity scores. All three of these algorithms produced modules (groups) that appear to reflect working hypotheses related to the coastal bathymetry, habitat types, and associated movement ecology of the tagged species. Spatial movement graphs were very different for each fish examined and reflect behavioral differences. Fish exhibited various movement patterns, some showing the pattern of a central place forager (bonefish), while others cruised along a territory (great barracuda and permit).},

The widely used Wisconsin Bioenergetics Model uses an energy-balance approach calculated on a daily time step and can be used to evaluate the effect of changes in prey resources on growth or food consumption. Bioenergetics models have been made for many important fishes within the Great Lakes. However, few have been developed for {US} Northeastern Continental Shelf fish species. Growth performance of Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine Atlantic cod during 2004 was examined using a bioenergetics model and available data on gut contents and growth of different ages. Growth efficiency, calculated from daily growth and consumption rates, was used as a measure of growth performance. Overall growth performance for Atlantic cod was significantly lower at Georges Bank than in Gulf of Maine. Monthly individual consumption demand and specific growth rates for Atlantic cod calculated from the bioenergetic model were significantly higher on Georges Bank than in the Gulf of Maine. Increasing water temperatures approached the upper limits of thermal tolerances for cod in Georges Bank, possibly leading to decreasing growth efficiencies. Growth efficiency of cod in the Gulf of Maine was less variable than on Georges Bank due to the more homogenous temperatures and energetic content of diets found in the former location.},

	abstract = {Fatty acids ({FA}) are increasingly being used in ecology to qualitatively infer diets of consumers. Analysis of {FA} data requires standardization to express {FAs} either in mg g−1 lipids, mg g−1 tissue, or as percentages of the total mass of {FAs}. Additionally, various transformations [square root, arcsin, log(X + 1), log-ratio, etc.] are often used to differentially weight the contribution of less abundant {FAs}. The choice of standardization unit and transformation can affect interpretations of results and ultimately our understanding of trophic relationships. Data from published feeding experiments were analyzed with visualization (i.e., {nMDS}) and multivariate rank-based methods (i.e. Mantel Tests) to evaluate how choice of standardization, transformation, and resemblance metric (i.e., Euclidean distance, Bray–Curtis similarities, etc.) reflects known dietary treatment groups. Our results indicate that diet interpretations were best inferred from data standardized to the total mass of {FAs} quantified. We found transforming data provided only weak advantages for discriminating among diet groups. Euclidean distances between {FA} proportions represented the known dietary differences to a high degree, are relatively easily interpretable, are applicable to a wide variety of statistical techniques, and are thus a reasonable choice of metric when analyzing {FA} proportions.},

	abstract = {Electronic telemetry is frequently used to document animal movement through time. Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific movement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available space, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts. For aquatic animal tracking data with significant measurement error, a Bayesian state-space model called the first-Difference Correlated Random Walk with Switching ({DCRWS}) has often been used for this purpose. However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate tracking data are now becoming more common. We developed a new hidden Markov model ({HMM}) for identifying behavioral states from animal tracks with negligible error, called the hidden Markov movement model ({HMMM}). We implemented as the basis for the {HMMM} the process equation of the {DCRWS}, but we used the method of maximum likelihood and the R package {TMB} for rapid model fitting. The {HMMM} was compared to a modified version of the {DCRWS} for highly accurate tracks, the {DCRWSNOME}, and to a common {HMM} for animal tracks fitted with the R package {moveHMM}. We show that the {HMMM} is both accurate and suitable for multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout, and blue shark, as well as to simulated data. The {HMMM} is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from animal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the popular {DCRWS} implementation and have highly accurate tracking data. It additionally provides a groundwork for development of more complex modeling of animal movement with {TMB}. To facilitate its uptake, we make it available through the R package swim.},

	doi = {10.3354/meps08382},
	abstract = {Mid to high-latitude marine ecosystems are characterized by strong intra-seasonal variability in productivity across multiple trophic levels. It is understood that climate variability, as well as projected climate change, is likely to cause substantial changes in the timing of key seasonal events, such as the spring phytoplankton bloom, dates of diapause for zooplankton, or nesting dates in seabirds. However, it is not well known how changes in timing across multiple trophic levels will impact predator-prey relationships. Several mechanistic hypotheses have been put forth to explain changes in fish production in relation to phenological variability of prey, including Cushing's (1990; Adv Mar Biol 26:249-293) 'match-mismatch' hypothesis, yet there have been few tests of these ideas relative to ongoing oceanographic change. In this Theme Section, we present 9 papers that relate ocean climate variability and climate change to timing of key events for zooplankton, fish, and seabirds from northern hemisphere marine ecosystems. They cover phenological variability and consequences of timing changes for species of the California Current, Gulf of Alaska, {NE} Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean and northern Japan Sea, all cold-water ecosystems, and highlight the importance of phenology as a key response variable, as well as the complexity of ecological relationships to be impacted by marine climate change. Multi-trophic level changes in phenology of species abundance and productivity are likely to have important consequences to marine ecosystem structure and function. © 2009 Inter-Research.},

	abstract = {Background: Central place foragers ({CPF}) rest within a central place, and theory predicts that distance of patches from this central place sets the outer limits of the foraging arena. Many marine ectothermic predators behave like {CPF} animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur 'travelling' costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these {CPF} predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) to generate 'activity seascapes', which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Results: Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature. Conclusions: We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as {CPFs}, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use. However, aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional {CPF} models. In particular, for species that never stop swimming, patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.},

	abstract = {To clarify food resource use and niche breadths of the Japanese fluvial sculpin Cottuspollux (large-egg type), listed by over half the prefectures as an endangered species, we examined the diet and food selectivity of 168 specimens at 7 locations in 3 tributaries that drain into the upper regions of the Chikuma River. A stomach pump was used to assess the stomach contents. In total, 2,833 aquatic organisms from more than 22 families were found in the stomachs. An index of relative importance ({IRI}) indicated that chironomid, baetid, and ephemerellid larvae were the major prey for the sculpin. Despite considerable variation in the composition of aquatic organisms among locations, sculpin exhibited strong food selectivity for baetid, glossosomatid, chironomid, and tipulid larvae at multiple locations. Each individual sculpin preyed upon 17. 2 prey items on average, and the number of prey items found in the stomach positively correlated with the number of prey families, regardless of sculpin body size. Of 22 prey families found form all stomachs we examined, each individual sculpin preyed upon only 3. 54 families on average. These findings suggest that sculpin may have relatively narrow niche breadths regardless of a considerable number of prey individuals in their stomachs. {GLM} results indicated that a model that incorporated water depth and sculpin body size was the most parsimonious model to explain the prey diversity index in the stomachs of the sculpins. The diversity index of aquatic organisms positively correlated with the mean water depth at each location. These data suggest that rivers with deeper water depths might allow colonization of a variety of aquatic organisms, which might be expected to enhance availability of prey potentially available for the sculpin. © 2012 The Ichthyological Society of Japan.},

We conducted a multivariate analysis of stomach contents from bottom-trawl surveys to assess the major factors that determine diet composition, to compare and contrast diets between species, and to compare the trophic role of the hakes in the northwest Atlantic to hakes in other ecosystems. These fish consume pelagic invertebrates (e.g. euphausiids and other shrimps) and pelagic fish prey, including conspecifics. The incidence of piscivory generally increases with increasing size. Regional and temporal (seasonal and yearly) variation in hake diets generally reflects differences in prey availability. Hakes are among the most abundant predators in continental shelf ecosystems worldwide. Fish prey consumption by hakes can be high and may be a primary source of mortality for economically important pelagic species.

	abstract = {Using real data sets of elasmobranch fishes as examples, this paper presents a critical review of selected methods and statistical approaches used in fish feeding studies and makes recommendations on the application of such methodology. The percent index of relative importance is proposed as a standardized measure in dietary analyses, and a three-dimensional graphical representation of the diet is introduced. Multiway contingency table (log-linear) analysis is recommended to test for dietary variations. Caution is advised when using rank correlation to study dietary overlap and parametric tests when stomach content data do not satisfy parametric assumptions. Sampling gear type, experimental design, and statistical tests can affect results on diel feeding chronology, and stomach content weights do not suffice to interpret diel feeding chronology. On the basis of sampling requirements and model assumptions, the Diana and Olson-Mullen methods appear to be the most appropriate approaches for estimating daily ration in sharks. Use of resampling techniques is highly desirable because they provide a measure of the error in daily ration estimates. Using several criteria to evaluate the best-fitting model of gastric evacuation in fishes is also strongly advocated. Overall, increased consolidation of methods and analyses is recommended to facilitate comparative studies. Résumé : En prenant pour exemples des séries de données réelles sur des poissons élasmobranches, nous présentons une analyse critique de certaines méthodes et approches statistiques utilisées dans les études sur l'alimentation des poissons, et nous faisons des recommandations sur l'application de cette méthodologie. Nous proposons un indice de l'importance relative en pourcentage comme mesure normalisée pour les analyses alimentaires, et nous introduisons une représentation graphique tridimensionnelle du régime alimentaire. L'analyse (log-linéaire) de tableaux multidimensionnels est recommandée pour étudier les variations dans l'alimentation. Nous conseillons la prudence dans l'emploi de la corrélation de rangs pour étudier les chevauchements dans le régime alimentaire et des tests paramétriques quand les données sur le contenu stomacal ne satisfont pas les hypothèses paramétriques. Le type d'engin utilisé pour l'échantillonnage, le protocole expérimental et les tests statistiques peuvent avoir un effet sur les résultats de la chronologie de l'alimentation nycthémérale, et le poids du contenu stomacal ne suffit pas à interpréter cette chronologie. D'après les besoins de l'échantillonnage et les hypothèses des modèles, les méthodes de Diana et d'Olsen-Mullen semblent être les plus appropriées pour estimer la ration quotidienne chez les requins. L'emploi de techniques de rééchantillonnage est très souhaitable car cette démarche donne une mesure de l'erreur dans les estimations de la ration quotidienne. Nous recommandons aussi fortement d'avoir recours à plusieurs critères pour évaluer le modèle qui offre le meilleur ajustement pour l'évacuation gastrique chez les poissons. Globalement, il est recommandé de regrouper de plus en plus les méthodes et les analyses pour faciliter les études comparatives. [Traduit par la Rédaction]},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0209032},
	abstract = {In ecological studies it is often assumed that predator foraging strategies and resource use are geographically and seasonally homogeneous, resulting in relatively static trophic relationships. However, certain centrally placed foragers (e.g. seals) often have terrestrial sites for breeding, resting, and moulting that are geographically distinct, and associated with different habitat types. Therefore, accurate estimations of predator diet at relevant spatial and temporal scales are key to understanding energetic requirements, predator-prey interactions and ecosystem structure. We investigate geographic variation in the diet of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), a relatively abundant and widely distributed central place forager, to provide insights into geographic variation in resource use. Prey composition was identified using scat samples collected over concurrent timescales and a multivariate approach was used to analyse diet from two contrasting habitats. Regional differences in prey assemblages occurred within all years (2011–2013) and all seasons ({ANOSIM}, all p{\textless}0.05), apart from in winter. Telemetry data were used to identify core foraging areas and habitats most likely associated with scat samples collected at the two haul-out sites. Regional differences in the diet appear to reflect regional differences in the physical habitat features, with seals foraging in deeper waters over sandy substrates showing a higher prevalence of pelagic and bentho-pelagic prey species such as blue whiting and sandeels. Conversely, seals foraging in comparatively shallow waters had a greater contribution of demersal and groundfish species such as cephalopods and flatfish in their diet. We suggest that shallower waters enable seals to spend more time foraging along the benthos while remaining within aerobic dive limits, resulting in more benthic species in the diet. In contrast, the diet of seals hauled-out in areas adjacent to deeper waters indicates that either seals engage in a more pelagic foraging strategy, or that seals can spend less time at the benthos, resulting in comparatively more pelagic prey recovered in the diet. The substantial differences in prey assemblages over a small spatial scale ({\textless}300 km) demonstrates the importance of using regionally-specific diet information in ecosystem-based models to better account for different trophic interactions.},

As anticipated, differences in routine metabolic rate observed among salmon stocks were largely explained by an exponential dependence on ambient water temperature. However, the relationship between water temperature and maximum oxygen consumption ({MO}2max), i.e. the {MO}2 measured at the critical swimming speed (Ucrit), revealed temperature optima for {MO}2max that were stock-specific. These temperature optima were very similar to the average ambient water temperatures for the natal stream of a given stock. Furthermore, at a comparable water temperature, the salmon stocks that experienced a long and energetically costly in-river migration were characterized by a higher {MO}2max, a higher scope for activity, a higher Ucrit and, in some cases, a higher cost of transport, relative to the coastal salmon stocks that experience a short in-river migration. We conclude that high-caliber respirometry can be performed in a field setting and that stock-specific differences in swimming performance of adult salmon may be important for understanding upstream migration energetics and abilities.},

Chinook salmon in laboratory tanks were fed alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), the predominant food of chinook salmon in Lake Michigan. Food consumption and growth by chinook salmon during the experiment were measured. To estimate the efficiency with which chinook salmon retain polychlorinated biphenyls ({PCBs}) from their food in the laboratory, {PCB} concentrations of the alewife and of the chinook salmon at both the beginning and end of the experiment were determined. Based on our laboratory evaluation, the bioenergetics model was furnishing unbiased estimates of food consumption by chinook salmon. Additionally, from the laboratory experiment, we calculated that chinook salmon retained 75\% of the {PCBs} contained within their food. In an earlier study, assimilation rate of {PCBs} to chinook salmon from their food in Lake Michigan was estimated at 53\%, thereby suggesting that the model was substantially overestimating food consumption by chinook salmon in Lake Michigan. However, we concluded that field performance of the model could not be accurately assessed because {PCB} assimilation efficiency is dependent on feeding rate, and feeding rate of chinook salmon was likely much lower in our laboratory tanks than in Lake Michigan.},

Despite their importance within the food-web, no method currently exists to estimate daily consumption for Great Lakes slimy (. Cottus cognatus) and deepwater sculpin (. Myoxocephalus thompsonii). We conducted experiments to estimate gastric evacuation ({GEVAC}) and collected field data from Lake Michigan to estimate index of fullness [(g prey/g fish weight)100\%) to determine daily ration for water temperatures ranging 2-5. °C, coinciding with the winter and early spring season. Exponential {GEVAC} rates equaled 0.0115/h for slimy sculpin and 0.0147/h for deepwater sculpin, and did not vary between 2.7. °C and 5.1. °C for either species or between prey types (. Mysis relicta and fish eggs) for slimy sculpin. Index of fullness varied with fish size, and averaged 1.93\% and 1.85\% for slimy and deepwater sculpins, respectively. Maximum index of fullness was generally higher (except for the smallest sizes) for both species in 2009-2010 than in 1976 despite reductions in a primary prey, Diporeia spp. Predictive daily ration equations were derived as a function of fish dry weight. Estimates of daily consumption ranged from 0.2 to 0.8\% of their body weight, which was within the low range of estimates from other species at comparably low water temperatures. These results provide a tool to estimate the consumptive demand of sculpins which will improve our understanding of benthic offshore food webs and aid in management and restoration of these native species in the Great Lakes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	doi = {10.1577/t05-045.1},
	abstract = {Many fish species are at risk to some degree, and conservation efforts are planned or underway to preserve sensitive populations. For many imperiled species, models could serve as useful tools for researchers and managers as they seek to understand individual growth, quantify predator-prey dynamics, and identify critical sources of mortality. Development and application of models for rare species however, has been constrained by small population sizes, difficulty in obtaining sampling permits, limited opportunities for funding, and regulations on how endangered species can be used in laboratory studies. Bioenergetic and life history models should help with endangered species-recovery planning since these types of models have been used successfully in the last 25 years to address management problems for many commercially and recreationally important fish species. In this paper we discuss five approaches to developing models and parameters for rare species. Borrowing model functions and parameters from related species is simple, but uncorroborated results can be misleading. Directly estimating parameters with laboratory studies may be possible for rare species that have locally abundant populations. Monte Carlo filtering can be used to estimate several parameters by means of performing simple laboratory growth experiments to first determine test criteria. Pattern-oriented modeling ({POM}) is a new and developing field of research that uses field-observed patterns to build, test, and parameterize models. Models developed using the {POM} approach are closely linked to field data, produce testable hypotheses, and require a close working relationship between modelers and empiricists. Artificial evolution in individual-based models can be used to gain insight into adaptive behaviors for poorly understood species and thus can fill in knowledge gaps. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2008.},

	abstract = {The construction of Glen Canyon Dam above the Grand Canyon (Arizona) has reduced the water temperature in the Colorado River and altered the growth rate and feeding patterns of the federally endangered humpback chub Gila cypha. A bioenergetics model for humpback chub was developed and used to examine how warmer water temperatures in the lower Colorado River (achieved through a temperature control device [{TCD}] at Glen Canyon Dam) might influence their growth rate and food requirements. Parameter values for humpback chub were developed by Monte Carlo filtering and fitting to laboratory growth. Parameter bounds were established from the literature for Gila species, random parameter sets were selected within these bounds, and the growth of modeled humpback chub was compared with criteria from a laboratory growth experiment at 24°C. This method of parameter estimation could be applied to other imperiled fishes where physiological studies are impractical. Final parameter values were corroborated by comparison with the growth rates of humpback chub from independent field and laboratory studies. Simulations indicated that increasing water temperatures from approximately 9°C to 16°C during summer and fall, the change expected from the {TCD}, may have a minimal effect on humpback chub growth rate unless food availability also increases with temperature. To evaluate the effects of increased temperatures on humpback chub in the lower Colorado River, it will be essential to monitor their growth rate, the invertebrate community, and the predators of humpback chub, which are also influenced by temperature changes. Bioenergetics models for humpback chub and their predators should be helpful tools for identifying potential scenarios and evaluating the complex interactions resulting from a {TCD}. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2005.},

This study used bioenergetics modeling of the dominant predator fish in the western arm of Lake Superior in 2004 to provide a comprehensive picture of the relationship between predator demand and prey fish availability. The results, presented for nearshore and offshore areas and three geographically distinct ecoregions, indicate that the western arm is at or near its carrying capacity for predators. Estimated predator demand was about one-half the annual biomass plus production of coregonines but exceeded the biomass plus production of rainbow smelt, possibly because of underestimates of this species in shallow areas and recent shifts in predator diets. Lean lake trout were responsible for most of the consumption of these prey fish, while the deepwater siscowet form ranked second. The commercial harvest of prey fish biomass was trivial compared with the consumption by predator fish. Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, along with other nearshore potamodromous species, played minor roles in total consumption. Chinook salmon are an indicator of forage status, as they have responded to declines in the rainbow smelt biomass with a dramatic diet shift to ciscoes and a decline in weight at age since the early 1990s. Slightly reduced lean lake trout growth and density-dependent survival in some areas also indicate that competition for prey is intense. Because most of the predators in the western arm are wild fish, stocked predators no longer have a great impact on prey populations.

	volume = {133},
	doi = {10.1577/02-116},
	abstract = {Bioenergetic models of fish have been used to study a large number of processes. Like most models, bioenergetic models require the estimation of numerous parameters. As a consequence, they have often relied on parameters borrowed from other species or values extrapolated from other life stages or size-classes. The magnitude of the biases associated with these practices remains largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether or not metabolic rates could be extrapolated between closely related species and life stages. We focused on Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead O. mykiss, as the metabolic rates of these species have been well documented. Our analyses showed that models derived from closely related species did not accurately predict the metabolic rates of salmon, indicating that the practice of ''species borrowing'' should be avoided in assessing fish metabolic rates. Our work also showed that allometric equations of metabolic rates were not stable when measured over small size ranges and that biases could be introduced when these models are extrapolated to smaller or larger fish. In addition, we found that, except for steelhead, published models of Pacific salmon metabolic rates were inaccurate. Mean bias ranged from close to 0\% to over 200\% depending on size and water temperature, with about two-thirds of the bias values exceeding 20\%. These biases could have large impacts on bioenergetic model predictions. Increased funding and scientific recognition of the need for additional basic research will be necessary to build more accurate bioenergetic models for Pacific salmon, especially models applied to the ocean phase of the life cycle.},

	abstract = {In light of an increasing trend in fish biology towards using static respirometry techniques without the inclusion of a mixing mechanism and without accurately accounting for the influence of microbial (background) respiration, this paper quantifies the effect of these approaches on the oxygen consumption rates (M˙O2) measured from juvenile barramundi Lates calcarifer (mean ± s.e. mass = 20·31 ± 0·81 g) and adult spiny chromis damselfish Acanthochromis polyacanthus (22·03 ± 2·53 g). Background respiration changed consistently and in a sigmoidal manner over time in the treatment with a mixing device (inline recirculation pump), whereas attempts to measure background respiration in the non-mixed treatment yielded highly variable estimates of M˙O2 that were probably artefacts due to the lack of water movement over the oxygen sensor during measurement periods. This had clear consequences when accounting for background respiration in the calculations of fish M˙O2. Exclusion of a mixing device caused a significantly lower estimate of M˙O2 in both species and reduced the capacity to detect differences between individuals as well as differences within an individual over time. There was evidence to suggest that the magnitude of these effects was dependent on the spontaneous activity levels of the fish, as the difference between mixed and non-mixed treatments was more pronounced for L. calcarifer (sedentary) than for A. polyacanthus (more spontaneously active). It is clear that respirometry set-ups for sedentary species must contain a mixing device to prevent oxygen stratification inside the respirometer. While more active species may provide a higher level of water mixing during respirometry measurements and theoretically reduce the need for a mixing device, the level of mixing cannot be quantified and may change with diurnal cycles in activity. To ensure consistency across studies without relying on fish activity levels, and to enable accurate assessments of background respiration, it is recommended that all respirometry systems should include an appropriate mixing device.},

to former abundance levels and on the degree to which their
persistence is threatened by extinction. Although potential for
recovery has been assessed indirectly, actual changes in population

empirically. Here I show that there is very little evidence for rapid
recovery from prolonged declines, in contrast to the perception
that marine fishes are highly resilient to large population
reductions. With the possible exception of herring and related
species that mature early in life and are fishedwith highly selective
equipment, my analysis of 90 stocks reveals that many gadids (for
example, cod, haddock) and other non-clupeids (for example,
flatfishes) have experienced little, if any, recovery as much as15 years after 45–99\% reductions in reproductive biomass.
Although the effects of overfishing on single species may generally
be reversible, the actual time required for recovery appears to be
considerable. To exempt marine fishes from existing criteria used
to assign extinction risk would be inconsistent with precautionary
approaches to fisheries management and the conservation

The human-induced Arctic moistening is consistent with observed increases in Arctic river discharge and freshening of Arctic water masses.

Neither model exhibited consistently better performance for predicting fish body masses across all four fish size and feeding regime combinations. Results indicated deficiencies in estimates of resting routine metabolism by both models. Both the {WI} and {KT} models exhibited errors for predicting growth rates, which were strongly correlated with food consumption rate. Consumption-dependent prediction errors may be common in bioenergetics models and are probably the result of deficiencies in parameter values or assumptions within the models for calculating energy costs of specific dynamic action, feeding activity metabolism or egestion and excretion. Inter-model differences in growth and consumption predictions were primarily the result of differences in egestion and excretion costs calculated by the two models. The results highlighted the potential importance of parameters describing egestion and excretion costs to the accuracy of bioenergetics model predictions, even though bioenergetics models are generally regarded as being insensitive to these parameters. The findings strongly emphasize the utility and necessity of performing laboratory evaluations of all bioenergetics models for assurance of model accuracy and for facilitation of model refinement. © 2003 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

The most apparent taxonomic shift was toward a higher relative abundance of the planktonic Cyclotella stelligera complex and a lower relative abundance of benthic Fragilaria taxa (F. pinnata, F. construens var. venter, F. construens, and F. brevistriata) in the modern versus the older sediments. Diatom assemblage composition in Slipper Lake recorded a marked change in the top 5.0 cm (ca. mid-1800s) of the core with a clear shift to a more planktonic diatom assemblage characterized by higher percentages of the Cyclotella stelligera complex. Possible causative factors, such as recent anthropogenic acidification, nutrient enrichment, or atmospheric deposition of contaminants, do not appear sufficient to explain these species changes. Instead, these recent assemblage shifts are consistent with limnological changes occurring with climatic warming, such as a shorter duration of ice cover, a longer growing season, and/or stronger thermal stratification patterns.},

The new parameter set was compared with the only previously published set for adult roach, where parameters were taken from different life stages and compiled from different studies.

The intermodel differences were most distinct at high ({\textgreater} 20°C) and low ({\textless} 10°C) temperatures, and can be mainly explained by differences in the temperature dependence of the respiration rate between the two sets.

	title = {An introduction to state-space modeling of ecological time series},
	abstract = {State-space models ({SSMs}) are an important modeling framework for analyzing eco-
logical time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population
dynamics and animal movement, and are now increasingly being used to model other
ecological processes. {SSMs} are popular because they are 
exible and they model the
natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their 
ex-
ibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with
linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the
two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to di erentiate between bio-
logical stochasticity (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the sampling method-
ology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest
than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of
{SSMs}, a broad range of  tting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety
and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and
 t their own {SSMs}. In addition, many {SSM} users are unaware of the potential esti-
mation problems they could encounter, and of the model selection and validation tools
that can help them assess how well their models  t their data. In this paper, we present
a review of {SSMs} that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learn-
ing about {SSMs}, introduce new tools to veteran {SSM} users, and highlight promising
research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review
is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how {SSMs} models can be
 tted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to
{SSMs} that will help ecologists to formulate,  t, and validate their models.},

Inter- and intraspecific competition and niche overlap were determined from multivariate analysis [the ordination technique, detrended correspondence analysis, cluster analysis by the Bray-Curtis equation, per cent overlap and two-way indicator species analysis ({TWINSPAN})]. The identity of the prey organisms are not lost in the comparisons, and the value of this is determined through comparison with techniques such as Shannon-Wiener which obscure these data. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was combined with an analysis of 'evenness' to refine the technique further to assess niche breadth, as was the Levins index. The study shows that to give an estimate of competition within the community, it is important to assess the data with respect to seasonal and temporal patterns using multivariate analysis.},

	abstract = {This study synthesizes results from observations, laboratory experiments and models to showcase how the integration of scientific methods and indigenous knowledge can improve our understanding of (a) past and projected changes in environmental conditions and marine species; (b) their effects on social and ecological systems in the respective communities; and (c) support management and planning tools for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The study links climate-ecosystem-economic ({CEE}) models and discusses uncertainties within those tools. The example focuses on the key forage species in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (Western Canadian Arctic), i.e., Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida). Arctic cod can be trophically linked to sea-ice algae and pelagic primary producers and are key vectors for energy transfers from plankton to higher trophic levels (e.g., ringed seals, beluga), which are harvested by Inuit peoples. Fundamental changes in ice and ocean conditions in the region affect the marine ecosystem and fish habitat. Model simulations suggest increasing trends in oceanic phytoplankton and sea-ice algae with high interannual variability. The latter might be linked to interannual variations in Arctic cod abundance and mask trends in observations. {CEE} simulations incorporating physiological temperature limits data for the distribution of Arctic cod, result in an estimated 17\% decrease in Arctic cod populations by the end of the century (high emission scenario), but suggest increases in abundance for other Arctic and sub-Arctic species. The Arctic cod decrease is largely caused by increased temperatures and constraints in northward migration, and could directly impact key subsistence species. Responses to acidification are still highly uncertain, but sensitivity simulations suggests an additional 1\% decrease in Arctic cod populations due to {pH} impacts on growth and survival. Uncertainties remain with respect to detailed future changes, but general results are likely correct and in line with results from other approaches. To reduce uncertainties, higher resolution models with improved parameterizations and better understanding of the species' physiological limits are required. Arctic communities should be directly involved, receive tools and training to conduct local, unified research and food chain monitoring while decisions regarding commercial fisheries will need to be precautionary and adaptive in light of the existing uncertainties.},

	abstract = {β-diversity represents the compositional variation among communities from site-to-site, linking local (α-diversity) and regional (γ-diversity). Researchers often desire to compare values of bdiversity across localities or experimental treatments, and to use this comparison to infer possible mechanisms of community assembly. However, the majority of metrics used to estimate β-diversity, including most dissimilarity metrics (e.g., Jaccard's and Sørenson's dissimilarity index), can vary simply because of changes in the other two diversity components (α or γ-diversity). Here, we overview the utility of taking a null model approach that allows one to discern whether variation in the measured dissimilarity among communities results more from changes in the underlying structure by which communities vary, or instead simply due to difference in α-diversity among localities or experimental treatments. We illustrate one particular approach, originally developed by Raup and Crick (1979) in the paleontological literature, which creates a re-scaled probability metric ranging from-1 to 1, indicating whether local communities are more dissimilar (approaching 1), as dissimilar (approaching 0), or less dissimilar (approaching -1), than expected by random chance. The value of this metric provides some indication of the possible underlying mechanisms of community assembly, in particular the degree to which deterministic processes create communities that deviate from those based on stochastic (null) expectations. We demonstrate the utility of this metric when compared to analyses of Jaccard's dissimilarity index with case studies from disparate empirical systems (coral reefs and freshwater ponds) that differ in the degree to which disturbance altered α-diversity, as well as the selectivity by which disturbance acted on members of the community. © 2011 Chase et al.},

In this paper, based on ethnographic research conducted with the Iñupiaq communities of Noatak and Selawik in northwestern Alaska, we detail prominent environmental changes observed over the past twenty to thirty years and their impacts on subsistence-based lifestyles. However, we suggest that it is ultimately insufficient to try to understand how Arctic communities are experiencing and responding to climate change in isolation from other stressors. During interviews and participant observation documenting local observations of climatic and related environmental shifts and impacts to subsistence fishing practices, we find the inseparability of environmental, social, economic, cultural, and political realms for community residents. Many of our informants, who live in a mixed economy based on various forms of income and widespread subsistence harvesting of fish and game, perceive and experience climate change as embedded among numerous other factors affecting subsistence patterns and practices. Changing lifestyles, decreasing interest by younger generations in pursuing subsistence livelihoods, and economic challenges are greatly affecting contemporary subsistence patterns and practices in rural Alaska. Observations of climate change are perceived, experienced, and articulated to researchers through a broader lens of these linked lifestyle and cultural shifts. Therefore, we argue that to properly assess and understand the impacts of climate change on the subsistence practices in Arctic communities, we must also consider the total environment of change that is dramatically shaping the relationship between people, communities, and their surrounding environments.},

We compared mortality and diet composition of stocked advanced-fingerling and early-cohort wild age-0 largemouth bass through 90 d poststocking. Our mortality estimates were similar for stocked (84\%) and early-cohort age-0 wild largemouth bass (95\%) based on the slope of a catch curve. We used a percent similarity index ({PSI}) to evaluate the diet composition of stocked and early-cohort wild age-0 largemouth bass. Diet composition was generally similar between stocked and wild fish, although the greatest dissimilarity occurred at 7 d poststocking ({PSI} = 0.48). Pearson chi-square analysis indicated that early-cohort age-0 wild largemouth bass had a significantly higher frequency of diets containing fish than stocked largemouth bass and that stocked fish had a significantly higher frequency of empty stomachs at 7 d poststocking. An inability to transition to natural prey, stresses from the stocking process, and/or other factors not measured in this study (e.g., predation) probably contributed to the mortality of stocked fish through 90 d poststocking. We recommend that hatchery managers and biologists conduct further research on the hatchery fish rearing protocol (e.g., transition to natural prey and habitat complexity in raceways) that may lead to increased survival of stocked advanced-fingerling largemouth bass.},

It was found that the transition from traditional outrigger canoes to outboard-powered vessels has caused a dramatic increase in catch rate. This has resulted in a reduction in fishing effort, rather than an increase fisheries yield, as the fishery remains governed by subsistence needs and population size. The introduction of fishing technology has had more of a social impact, rendering the traditional shore-based fishing conducted by women less important. This study indicates that the reefs of Ono-i-Lau have sustained a yield of between 2.9 and 3.7 tonnes km-2 year-1 of reef-associated fish over the 20-year period. This provides a useful reference point from which to compare other reef fisheries in the region. The findings of this study also support the argument that non-selective harvesting of finfish can minimize the probability of ecosystem shifts. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Telemetry is an increasingly common tool for studying the ecology of wild fish, with great potential to provide valuable information for management and conservation. For researchers to conduct a robust telemetry study, many essential considerations exist related to selecting the appropriate tag type, fish capture and tagging methods, tracking protocol, data processing and analyses, and interpretation of findings. For telemetry-derived knowledge to be relevant to managers and policy makers, the research approach must consider management information needs for decision-making, while end users require an understanding of telemetry technology (capabilities and limitations), its application to fisheries research and monitoring (study design), and proper interpretation of results and conclusions (considering the potential for biases and proper recognition of associated uncertainties). To help bridge this gap, we provide a set of considerations and a checklist for researchers to guide them in conducting reliable and management-relevant telemetry studies, and for managers to evaluate the reliability and relevance of telemetry studies so as to better integrate findings into management plans. These considerations include implicit assumptions, technical limitations, ethical and biological realities, analytical merits, and the relevance of study findings to decision-making processes.},

	abstract = {Traditional foods that First Nations peoples harvest or gather from the land remain critically important for achieving and sustaining food security for many communities. In Canada’s North, land claim agreements include provisions for First Nations to participate in the governance of their traditional territories, including the co-management of important traditional (wild-harvested) food species. Because such agreements only specify the broad contours of co-management governance, their actual functioning evolves out of a complex interplay among the co-managing organizations over the course of time. This paper aims to deepen our understanding of how First Nations communities can enhance food security as participants in co-management. Our study connects research on food security with research on co-management and is the first to analyze how First Nations can improve their food security by influencing decision-making that affects traditional foods through co-management arrangements. Following a succinct review of the Indigenous food security and co-management literatures, we analyze the experiences of Kluane First Nation in enhancing community food security through the co-management of its traditional territory with Yukon Government and Parks Canada, interpreting the data in light of the theories and evidences offered by research on co-management. The analysis of data collected from semi-structured interviews and from First Nations and government resources shows that, while the co-management system is imperfect, it does offer a mechanism through which First Nations can exert influence on decisions that affect their food security. The three key themes emerging from the excerpts confirm the importance of co-management as an evolutionary and long-term process, in which trust-and relationship-building are ongoing activities that are fundamental to beneficial collaboration involving the sharing of information and power. The analysis also highlights the role of context, or situational factors, in facilitating or hindering collaboration.},

	abstract = {Fisheries usually first remove large predators before switching to smaller species, causing lasting changes to fish community structure. Reef fish provide essential protein and income for many people, and the impacts of commercial and high-intensity subsistence fishing on reef fish are well documented. However, how fish communities respond to low levels of subsistence fishing using traditional techniques (fishing for food, few fishers) is less well understood. We use three atolls in the Marshall Islands as a model system to quantify effects of commercial and subsistence fishing on reef fish communities, compared to a near-pristine baseline. Unexpectedly, fish biomass was highest on the commercially- fished atoll where the assemblage was dominated by herbivores (50\% higher than other atolls) and contained few top predators (70\% lower than other atolls). By contrast, fish biomass and trophic composition did not differ between pristine and subsistence-fished atolls - top predators were abundant on both. We show that in some cases, reefs can support fishing by small communities to provide food but still retain intact fish assemblages. Low-intensity subsistence fishing may not always harm marine food webs, and we suggest that its effects depend on the style and intensity of fishing practised and the type of organisms targeted.},

	volume = {19},
	doi = {10.1111/faf.12248},
	abstract = {Fishing can drive changes in important phenotypic traits through plastic and evolutionary pathways. Size-selective harvest is a primary driver of such trait change, has received much attention in the literature and is now commonly considered in fisheries management. The potential for selection on behavioural traits has received less study, but mounting evidence suggests that aggression, foraging behaviour and linked traits can also be affected by fishing. An important phenomenon that has received much less attention is selection on reproductive phenology (i.e., the timing of breeding). The potential for this type of “temporal selection” is widespread because there is often substantial variability in reproductive phenology within fish populations, and fisheries management strategies or fishermen's behaviours can cause fishing effort to vary greatly over time. For example, seasonal closures may expose only early or late breeding individuals to harvest as observed in a range of marine and freshwater fisheries. Such selection may induce evolutionary responses in phenological traits, but can also have demographic impacts such as shortened breeding seasons and reduced phenotypic diversity. These changes can in turn influence productivity, reduce the efficacy of management, exacerbate ongoing climate-driven changes in phenology and reduce resilience to environmental change. In this essay, we describe how fisheries management can cause temporal variability in harvest, and describe the types of selection on temporal traits that can result. We then summarize the likely biological consequences of temporally selective fishing on populations and population complexes and conclude by identifying areas for future research.},

	abstract = {Individuals often show considerable variance in social behaviour and aggression, leading to defined social roles. Removal of individuals with particular roles from groups may have impacts on group function, leaving those groups less able to locate critical resources and avoid danger. In recreational fisheries, capture by humans constitutes a mortality risk, and therefore angling has the potential to fundamentally alter social structure in exploited populations if individuals with defined social roles are disproportionately captured. However, little work has examined the linkage between social behaviour and angling vulnerability. To address this gap, we conducted a study on bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, a freshwater fish known to be socially gregarious, and a common target of recreational anglers in North America. Fish were angled in a naturalistic pond setting, and a subset of captured and uncaptured fish was then assessed for sociability in a shoaling assay and aggression/dominance in paired dyadic contests. Results showed a significant effect of time spent in the social zone on capture status, with captured individuals spending significantly more time near a transparent divider separating it from a shoal of conspecifics compared to uncaptured fish. Dominance was not associated with angling vulnerability, and sociability was not linked with dominance. Collectively, these results show that more social bluegill are more likely to be captured by anglers. This could in turn lead to decreased social functionality in exploited populations as a result of the removal of particularly social individuals, as well as possible evolution of social behaviour in exploited populations due to this selection.},

This archeological fact suggests that their societies had achieved sustainability and resilience in relationships to their ecosystems and the salmon runs. The governance principles used by Northwest Indians in managing fisheries and other resources provided resilience. In addition to a land ethic, these principles included exchange systems based on public reciprocity. Property rights were clear and trespass was a capital offense. Chiefs and titleholders had to be generous facilitators. Leadership authority over land was contingent upon adherence to ethical and generous behavior as well as good management. These indigenous institutions were quite different from the rules currently governing the management of most ecosystems. In critiquing current institutions, many ideas similar to those in the indigenous systems have been proposed in isolation; the example described in this paper suggests the importance of combining them. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In fisheries, most research has focused on industrial sectors, with the contributions to global resource use bysmall-scale and indigenous hunters andfishers undervalued. Globally, the small-scale fisheries sector alone employs some 38 million people who share common challenges in balancing livelihood andlifestyle choices.We used as a case study a fisherywith both traditional indigenous and commercial sectors to develop a framework to bridge the gap between quantitative bio-economic models and more qualitative social analyses. For many indigenous communities, communalism rather than capitalism underlies fishers' perspectives and aspirations, and we find there are complicated and often unanticipated trade-offs between economic and social objectives. Our results highlight that market-based management options might score highly in a capitalistic society, but have negative repercussions on community coherence and equity in societies with a strong communal ethic. There are complex trade-offs between economic indicators, such as profit, and social indicators, such as lifestyle preferences. Our approach makes explicit the "triple bottom line" sustainability objectives involving trade-offs between economic, social, and biological performance, and is thus directly applicable to most natural resource management decision-making situations.},

They are usually economically and politically marginalized, and therefore vulnerable to large-scale threats (e.g., globalized markets). To support this sector and contribute to its sustainability, we argue that it is fundamental to understand how economically viable small-scale fisheries are. Hence, the main objective of this article is to critically review and describe the current discourse on the economic viability of small-scale fisheries. We find that currently, economic viability is mainly equated with financial viability, where profitability is the goal. In consideration of socio-economic aspects, the maintenance of nonnegative net benefits to society is often not considered in current notions of economic viability. While these shortcomings have been acknowledged in some of the existing literature, our review shows that they have not yet been addressed comprehensively. We therefore conclude that it is necessary to develop or expand current methods to better take into account social aspects when assessing the economic viability of small-scale fisheries. This would help find solutions to make these fisheries less vulnerable and better equipped to face large-scale processes of change.},

Commercial fishing in Norway House takes place during spring/summer and fall seasons, whereas subsistence fishing takes place throughout the year. Commercial fishing mostly occurs in the open waters of Lake Winnipeg; subsistence fishing in rivers adjacent to the reserve and in smaller lakes inland. How do fishers and the community deal with overlaps and potential conflicts between the two kinds of fisheries? The main mechanism is the separation of the two temporally and spatially. In the remaining overlap areas, conflict resolution relies on monitoring of net ownership and informal communication. The first mechanism is regulatory but really de facto co-management in the way it is implemented. The second is consistent with Cree cultural values of respect, reciprocity and tolerance.},

	abstract = {Fishers’ knowledge research is an approach to fisheries research that has a relatively long history, yet has generally failed to become integrated into the fisheries science mainstream alongside approaches that rely primarily on the knowledge of professional scientists. Its continued position on the margins of fisheries science has not however stopped fishers’ knowledge researchers from publishing an expanding literature, which they often use to advocate for the greater consideration of fishers’ knowledge by fisheries scientists and managers. They believe that the unique and often highly qualitative knowledgeof fishers could inform better decision-making, resulting in improved socio-ecologicaloutcomesfor fisheries. This review first outlines the scope of the fishers’ knowledge literature, before outlining five waves of fishers’ knowledge research that have developed over the last century. For each wave, the nature of the fishers’ knowledge documented during it is noted, as is the research and dissemination approach taken by its practitioners. The impact of that wave on mainstream fisheries science is then assessed. Overall, it is found that only one wave of fishers’ knowledge research is beginning to have consistent success integrating with mainstream fisheries science, a wave that omits the research of many of the unique elements of fishers’ knowledge. Other waves have died out, or are in danger of dying out, either because they have failed to be noticed by mainstream fisheries scientists or because mainstream fisheries scientists have not welcomed their outputs. It is summarized that fishers’ knowledge research will only continue as a productive activity if mainstream fisheries scientists begin to open their discipline to other knowledge cultures and if fishers’ knowledge researchers facilitate this action by disseminating their research so that it is more accessible to these scientists.},

	abstract = {Long-term trends in fish age and size at maturation provide important insights into population stability as they are affected by changes in growing conditions. Fishery exploitation and selection can also induce such trends. It is important to identify the causes of changing life history patterns because they affect population dynamics and productivity. Average body sizes or ages of many western North American populations of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, including the Nushagak River population in Bristol Bay, Alaska, have declined over the past several decades. This population is caught in commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries and therefore represents an opportunity to compare fishery exploitation and selection and to examine their possible effects. We compiled data and examined trends in size and age at maturation between 1981 and 2009, and we then quantified commercial and recreational fishery exploitation and selection rates. The average age and lengths at most ages of maturing fish decreased over time. The commercial fishery caught the majority (73\%) of the harvested fish annually compared with the recreational (9\%) and subsistence fisheries (18\%). Size selection by the commercial fishery was highly variable over time, but overall, smaller-than-average fish were caught, inconsistent with the declining trends in age and size of returning fish. In contrast, the recreational fishery and presumably the subsistence fishery regularly removed larger-than-average fish, consistent with the trends. However, the opposing selection by the commercial fishery suggests that the trends in age and size at maturation are unlikely to have been caused solely by fishery selection. Rather, the trends are probably also related to environmental changes affecting fish growth. Still, regulations that decrease either the allowable size of harvested Chinook salmon or the allowable number of large fish may help to decrease the size selectivity of the Nushagak River recreational and subsistence fisheries. © American Fisheries Society 2011.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.fishres.2004.05.013},
	abstract = {Societies in the South Pacific are undergoing transition from reciprocity exchange and direct sustenance systems into cash based economies. The Kingdom of Tonga was selected to represent this socio-economic change. In this context, the economic viability of Tonga's subsistence and small-scale artisanal fisheries and marketing of reef and lagoon fish is assessed. Case studies were selected to represent three major geographical regions (Ha'apai, Vava'u, Tongatapu) and four major fisher groups (simple to very specialised and multi-geared fishing systems combined with cost of motorised boat transport, operational cost and fish market price). Marketing systems included operations of agents, middleman and shop owners. Economic assessment was performed by employing net present value ({NPV}) to explain the logic and to valorise fisheries and marketing systems against net revenues from employment and traditional agricultural production schemes. This paper also illustrates the limitations of conventional economic analysis. While {NPV} proved to be a useful instrument to compare fisheries and alternative sources of income, it failed to assess social and traditional values that determine the rather non-economical and non-rational subsistence and small-scale fisheries systems in the Tongan and South Pacific context. The conflict between applying mainly non-valorisation of societal and traditional values rather than underlying normal market behaviour rendered most fishing operations economically not viable or less attractive than agricultural production schemes and salaries from low skilled labour. Under these conditions, most Tongan fisheries do not reach the following suite of parameters required to make an operation economically attractive: minimum catch volume of 90-100 kg/week, a catch per unit effort of ≥5.8 kg/h, lowest possible operational cost and easy access to market selling prices of ≥5 {TOP}/kg fish. It was found that productivity increases from spear fishing to handline and multi-geared fisheries. Among small-scale fish marketing strategies, selling fish as a complementary activity to normal shop operations seems to be more lucrative than using agents and middlemen. Discussions focus on explaining the rationale of Tongan fishers by extending arguments beyond the economic and rationale framework. Major economic parameters such as labour and time are not accounted for in the traditional social environment. It is further argued that social considerations are impediments to economic rationale as they do not aim at catch maximisation, risk minimisation and innovation principles but the need to satisfy subsistence, social obligations and networking for societal resilience and insurance. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {There are two broadly conceptualized ways in which conservation knowledge may evolve: the depletion crisis model and the ecological understanding model. The first one argues that developing conservation thought and practice depends on learning that resources are depletable. Such learning typically follows a resource crisis. The second mechanism emphasizes the development of conservation practices following the incremental elaboration of environmental knowledge by a group of people. These mechanisms may work together. Following a perturbation, a society can self-organize, learn and adapt. The self-organizing process, facilitated by knowledge development and learning, has the potential to increase the resilience (capability to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change) of resource use systems. Hence, conservation knowledge can develop through a combination of long-term ecological understanding and learning from crises and mistakes. It has survival value, as it increases the resilience of integrated social--ecological systems to deal with change in ways that continue to sustain both peoples and their environments. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

	abstract = {In the western North Atlantic, great shearwaters Puffinus gravis are among the most abundant seabirds during summer months, yet little is known about their movement ecology and habitat requirements in this ecosystem. We deployed platform terminal transmitters on shearwaters captured in the Gulf of Maine and used a Bayesian switching state-space model to describe bird movements, behavior, foraging areas, migration timing, and how such habitat use and movements might be related to age. From July to November, great shearwaters traveled an average of 515 km per week and spent most of their time foraging around the rim of the gulf, primarily using shallower waters ({\textless}100 m), where bathymetry was more steeply sloped. A generalized additive model fit to these foraging locations data revealed correlations between foraging habitat use and depth, chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature, but not slope. Interestingly, these relationships were not consistent across birds from different tagging sites, suggesting a flexible foraging strategy based on local habitat conditions and high mobility. Movements associated with the shearwaters' southern migration began in August and continued through much of September, with birds leaving the study area via a pathway south of Nova Scotia, Canada. Nape plumage analysis showed most of the captured birds in the Gulf of Maine were young birds; 89\% were {\textless}3 yr old. These results suggest that modeling shearwater location information using state-space models can be useful in identifying discrete, high-use habitat patches as part of efforts to reduce fishery bycatch.},

	abstract = {The Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla is the most abundant gull species in the world, but some populations have declined in recent years, apparently due to food shortage. Kittiwakes are surface feeders and thus can compensate for low food availability only by increasing their foraging range and/or devoting more time to foraging. The species is widely studied in many respects, but long-distance foraging and the limitations of conventional radio telemetry have kept its foraging behavior largely out of view. The development of Global Positioning System ({GPS}) loggers is advancing rapidly. With devices as small as 8 g now available, it is possible to use this technology for tracking relatively small species of oceanic birds like kittiwakes. Here we present the first results of {GPS} telemetry applied to Black-legged Kittiwakes in 2007 in the North Pacific. All but one individual foraged in the neritic zone north of the island. Three birds performed foraging trips only close to the colony (within 13 km), while six birds had foraging ranges averaging about 40 km. The maximum foraging range was 59 km, and the maximum distance traveled was 165 km. Maximum trip duration was 17 h (mean 8 h). An apparently bimodal distribution of foraging ranges affords new insight on the variable foraging behaviour of Black-legged Kittiwakes. Our successful deployment of {GPS} loggers on kittiwakes holds much promise for telemetry studies on many other bird species of similar size and provides an incentive for applying this new approach in future studies. © 2009 Dt.

There are several forms of transforming the data to ranks. {RT}-1 refers to ranking all of the data together, and giving the smallest observation the rank 1, the second smallest the rank 2, and so on. {RT}-2 involves ranking data within subgroups only, and not comparing data across subgroups. {RT}-3 involves re-expressing the data prior to ranking, such as subtracting a sample mean or median from the data and taking an absolute value of the difference prior to ranking. {RT}-4 describes situations where data are re-expressed within subgroups, and then ranked within subgroups. The rank transformation is a convenient way to bridge the pedagogical gap between parametric and nonparametric methods in statistics. First present the classical statistical procedure, such as a t test or a correlation coefficient, and then perform the same operation on the ranks of the data instead of the data themselves. The resulting method is equivalent to the standard presentation of nonparametric methods, and is amenable to convenient use in computer software.

Changes in the cryosphere dominate the physical changes that already affect these animals, but increasing air temperatures, changes in precipitation, and ocean acidification will also affect Arctic ecosystems in the future. Adaptation via natural selection is problematic in such a rapidly changing environment. Adjustment via phenotypic plasticity is therefore likely to dominate Arctic vertebrate responses in the short term, and many such adjustments have already been documented. Changes in phenology and range will occur for most species but will only partly mitigate climate change impacts, which are particularly difficult to forecast due to the many interactions within and between trophic levels.

Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the {IPCC}) that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

	volume = {89},
	abstract = {n increasing number of studies in a wide range of natural systems have investigated how pulses of resource availability influence ecological processes at individual, population, and community levels. Taken together, these studies suggest that some common processes may underlie pulsed resource dynamics in a wide diversity of systems. Developing a common framework of terms and concepts for the study of resource pulses may facilitate greater synthesis among these apparently disparate systems. Here, we propose a general definition of the resource pulse concept, outline some common patterns in the causes and consequences of resource pulses, and suggest a few key questions for future investigations. We define resource pulses as episodes of increased resource availability in space and time that combine low frequency (rarity), large magnitude (intensity), and short duration (brevity), and emphasize the importance of considering resource pulses at spatial and temporal scales relevant to specific resource-consumer interactions. Although resource pulses are uncommon events for consumers in specific systems, our review of the existing literature suggests that pulsed resource dynamics are actually widespread phenomena in nature. Resource pulses often result from climatic and environmental factors, processes of spatiotemporal accumulation and release, outbreak population dynamics, or a combination of these factors. These events can affect life history traits and behavior at the level of individual consumers, numerical responses at the population level, and indirect effects at the community level. Consumers show strategies for utilizing ephemeral resources opportunistically, reducing resource variability by averaging over larger spatial scales, and tolerating extended interpulse periods of reduced resource availability. Resource pulses can also create persistent effects in communities through several mechanisms. We suggest that the study of resource pulses provides opportunities to understand the dynamics of many specific systems, and may also contribute to broader ecological questions at individual, population, and community levels},

	abstract = {Resource pulses are infrequent, large-magnitude, and short-duration events of increased resource availability. They include a diverse set of extreme events in a wide range of ecosystems, but identifying general patterns among the diversity of pulsed resource phenomena in nature remains an important challenge. Here we present a meta-analysis of resource pulse-consumer interactions that addresses four key questions: (1) Which characteristics of pulsed resources best predict their effects on consumers? (2) Which characteristics of consumers best predict their responses to resource pulses? (3) How do the effects of resource pulses differ in different ecosystems? (4) What are the indirect effects of resource pulses in communities? To investigate these questions, we built a data set of diverse pulsed resource-consumer interactions from around the world, developed metrics to compare the effects of resource pulses across disparate systems, and conducted multilevel regression analyses to examine the manner in which variation in the characteristics of resource pulseconsumer interactions affects important aspects of consumer responses. Resource pulse magnitude, resource trophic level, resource pulse duration, ecosystem type and subtype, consumer response mechanisms, and consumer body mass were found to be key explanatory factors predicting the magnitude, duration, and timing of consumer responses. Larger consumers showed more persistent responses to resource pulses, and reproductive responses were more persistent than aggregative responses. Aquatic systems showed shorter temporal lags between peaks of resource availability and consumer response compared to terrestrial systems, and temporal lags were also shorter for smaller consumers compared to larger consumers. The magnitude of consumer responses relative to their resource pulses was generally smaller for the direct consumers of primary resource pulses, compared to consumers at greater trophic distances from the initial resource pulse. In specific systems, this data set showed both attenuating and amplifying indirect effects. We consider the mechanistic processes behind these patterns and their implications for the ecology of resource pulses. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Increased nocturnal activity appeared to be related to feeding periodicity, as a substantially greater proportion (70\%) of spotted gars collected at night (N = 30) contained food compared with dawn, day, and dusk samples (29\%; N = 90). Seasonal movement studies (twice-weekly locations; N = 37 fish) indicated that spotted gar activity increased as water temperature and river stage rose in the spring, resulting in greater median movement rates (130.1 m/d) and home ranges (265.1 ha) than during fall–winter (35.8 m/d; 6.2 ha) and summer (34.6 m/d; 10.5 ha).

	abstract = {Simulations are necessary to assess the performance of home-range estimators because the true distribution of empirical data is unknown, but we must question whether that performance applies to empirical data. Some studies have used empirically based simulations, randomly selecting subsets of data to evaluate estimator performance, but animals do not move randomly within a home range. We created an empirically based simulation using a behavioral model, generated a probability distribution from those data, and randomly selected locations from that distribution in a chronological sequence as the simulated individual moved through its home range. Thus, we examined the influence of temporal patterns of space use and determined the effects of smoothing, number of locations, and autocorrelation on kernel estimates. Additionally, home-range estimators were designed to evaluate species that use space with few restrictions, traveling almost anywhere on the landscape. Many species, however, confine their movements to a geographical feature that conforms to a relatively linear pattern. Consequently, conventional analysis techniques may overestimate home ranges. We used simulations based upon coastal river otters (Lontra canadensis), a species that primarily uses the aquatic-terrestrial interface, to evaluate the efficacy of fixed and adaptive kernel estimates with various smoothing parameters. Measures of shoreline length within contours from fixed kernel analyses and the reference smoothing parameter were best for estimates of 95\% home ranges, because smoothing with least squares cross validation ({LSCV}) often resulted in inconsistent results, excessive fragmentation, and marked underestimates of linear home ranges. Core areas (50\% density contours) were best defined with fixed kernel {LSCV} estimates. Fewer locations underestimated linear home ranges, and there was a subtle positive relation between home-range size and autocorrelation. Generally, as location numbers increased, autocorrelation increased, but differences from the "true" home range decreased. Results were similar for our simulations and empirical data from 13 river otters. Examination of empirical data revealed that data with high positive autocorrelation illustrated seasonal reproductive activities. Because autocorrelation does not negatively influence estimates of linear home ranges, assessment of independence between data points may be more appropriately viewed as a means to identify important behavioral information, rather than as a hindrance.},

We determined movement and habitat use for 25 fish in the Current River, Missouri, for 1 year using radio telemetry. Seasonal movements were recorded two or three times each week during daylight hours from January to November 1988. Diel movement and habitat use were recorded once each hour for 17 d in winter and 12 d in summer. Mean daily distance traveled was greater in summer (425 m) than in winter (276 m). Home range was greater in winter and spring (812 m) than in summer and fall (426 m). Habitat use changed seasonally from slower, deeper water and smaller substrates during winter to increasing use of faster, shallower water and larger substrates through warmer-water periods. In both seasons, fish had a consistent daily pattern, moving more during the day than at night. Diel patterns of use were distinct. In winter, fish used pool habitat with moderate flow during the day and riffle or edge habitat at night. In summer, fish used run habitat during the day and riffle or edge habitat at night. Patterns of habitat use indicated fish used one area of the river during the day to feed and another at night to rest. Fish remained in their home area during high-flow events but used flooded riparian areas where current velocities were lower. Fish moved up- or downstream short distances (mean = 497 m, N = 7) into spawning areas during late February and early March. This study emphasizes the importance of habitat diversity to accommodate this species' diel and seasonal preferences and the necessity of a connected floodplain for the fish to survive catastrophic events.},

Temporal dynamics of winter habitat conditions were evaluated by regularly measuring the features of 30 pools and 5 beaver Castor canadensis ponds in the study reach. Groundwater inputs at three locations raised mean daily water temperatures in the stream channel during winter to 0.2–0.6C and kept at least 250 m of the downstream channel free of ice, but the lack of surface ice further downstream led to the occurrence of frazil ice and anchor ice in pools and unstable habitat conditions for trout. Pools in segments that were not affected by groundwater inputs and beaver ponds tended to be stable and snow accumulated on the surface ice. Pools throughout the study reach tended to become more stable as snow accumulated. Both cutthroat trout and brook trout selected beaver ponds as winter progressed but tended to use lateral scour pools in proportion to their availability. Tagged fish not in beaver ponds selected lateral scour pools that were deeper than average and stable during winter. Movement frequencies by tagged fish decreased from fall through winter, but some individuals of both species moved during winter.

High detection efficiency (mean ± standard error = 0.76 ± 0.03) of {PIT}-tagged fish was obtained with a portable antenna. Nighttime searches were more effective than daytime relocations in summer, and smaller fish ({\textless}65 mm) were detected more readily than larger fish (≥65 mm). Sculpins used erosional habitats more than depositional habitats, particularly during summer and nighttime. Search attempts within a 150 m reach showed that displacement, mean movement distance, and home range did not differ significantly between summer and winter, suggesting that season did not strongly influence movement. Additionally, movement metrics were unrelated to sculpin size. However, supplementary searches of a larger reach (700 m) showed that 16\% of {PIT}-tagged fish moved more than 100 m over 1 year, with a maximum displacement of 511 m, and mobile fish typically displayed upstream bias. Although most mottled sculpins in our system were relatively sedentary, a small proportion of individuals moved further than previously reported for other systems.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic-induced change is forcing organisms to shift their distributions and colonize novel habitats at an increasing rate, which leads to complex interactions among evolutionary processes. Coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) have colonized recently deglaciated streams of Glacier Bay in Alaska within the last 220 years. We examined divergence among populations in background matching coloration and tested the hypothesis that observed variation is due to morphological color plasticity. To examine how color-change plasticity has interacted with other evolutionary processes, we also determined the influence of colonization on neutral genetic diversity. We observed clinal variation in substrate-matching fish color along the chronological continuum of streams. Microsatellites provided little evidence of genetic subdivision among sculpin populations. Fish color was significantly correlated to substrate color, but was not correlated to neutral population genetic structure. Furthermore, a laboratory experiment revealed that morphological color plasticity could explain much, but not all, of the observed fish color divergence. Our study demonstrates that sculpin in Glacier Bay have colonized and adapted to recently deglaciated habitat and suggests that color change plasticity has aided in this process. This research, therefore, highlights the important role phenotypic plasticity may play in the adaptation of species to rapid climate change. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence cod larvae experienced faster growth in warmer water and low. uniform survival across all experimental temperatures (3, 7, 11 °C), consistent with previous studies on this spring-spawning population. In contrast, larvae from fall-spawning Southwestern Scotian Shelf cod collected near Sambro, Nova Scotia, lacked plasticity for growth but experienced much lower survival at higher temperatures. Phenotypes that are positively associated with fitness were observed at temperatures closest to those experienced in the wild, consistent with the hypothesis that these populations are adapted to local thermal regimes. The lack of growth plasticity observed in Sambro cod might be due to costly maintenance of plasticity in stable environments or energy savings at cold temperatures. However, additional experiments need to be conducted on Sambro cod and other fall-spawning marine fishes to determine to what extent responses to projected changes in climate will differ among populations.},

	abstract = {Aquatic organisms exposed to high flow regimes typically exhibit adaptations to decrease overall drag and increase friction with the substrate. However, these adaptations have not yet been examined on a structural level. Sculpins (Scorpaeniformes: Cottoidea) have regionalized pectoral fins that are modified for increasing friction with the substrate, and morphological specialization varies across species. We examined body and pectoral fin morphology of 9 species to determine patterns of body and pectoral fin specialization. Intact specimens and pectoral fins were measured, and multivariate techniques determined the differences among species. Cluster analysis identified 4 groups that likely represent differences in station-holding demand, and this was supported by a discriminant function analysis. Primarily, the high-demand group had increased peduncle depth (specialization for acceleration) and larger pectoral fins with less webbed ventral rays (specialization for mechanical gripping) compared to other groups; secondarily, the high-demand group had a greater aspect ratio and a reduced number of pectoral fin rays (specialization for lift generation) than other groups. The function of sculpin pectoral fins likely shifts from primarily gripping where demand is likely low, to an equal dependence on gripping and negative lift generation where demand is likely high. Specialization of the ventral pectoral fin region for gripping likely contributes to the recent diversification of some species into high-demand habitats. © 2012 Elsevier {GmbH}.},

	abstract = {Studies on the feeding ecology of fish are essential for exploring and contrasting trophic interactions and population and community dynamics within and among aquatic ecosystems. In this respect, many different methods have been adopted for the analysis of fish stomach contents. No consensus has, however, been reached for a standardised methodology despite that for several decades there has been an ongoing debate about which methodical approaches that should be preferred. Here, we critically review and scrutinise methods, addressing their strengths and weaknesses and emphasising inherent problems and possible pitfalls in their use. Although our critical assessment reveals that no completely ideal approach exists, appropriate and reliable procedures can be adopted through careful considerations and implementation. In particular, we advocate that different objectives require different methodical approaches and the choice of method should therefore be closely linked to the research questions that are addressed. For a standardisation of methods, we recommend a combination of the relative-fullness and presence–absence methods as the optimal approach for the commonly applied feeding studies addressing relative dietary composition in terms of prey diversity and abundance. Additionally, we recommend the gravimetric method for objectives related to the quantification of food consumption rates and the numerical method for prey selection studies. {DNA}-based dietary analysis provides a new and promising complementary approach to visual examination of stomach contents, although some technical challenges still exist. The suggested method standardisation facilitates comparisons across species, ecosystems and time and will enhance the applicability and benefits of fish feeding studies in trophic ecology research.},

These fishes were collected in 2013–2015 from the Arctic Ocean, Alaska, Japan. We could identify 8 distinct {DNA} sequences exhibiting a high similarity to those reported for Myoxocephalus species, suggesting that Cottidae and Agonidae share the same {DNA} sequence encoding type I {AFP}. Among the 3 families, Rhamphocottidae that experience a warm current did not show antifreeze activity. The species inhabiting the Arctic Ocean and Northern Japan that often covered with ice floe showed high activity, while those inhabiting Alaska, Southern Japan with a warm current showed low/no activity.

	abstract = {Diapause is a type of dormancy that requires preparation, typically precedes the onset of unfavorable conditions, and necessitates a period of arrest before development can proceed. Two ecologically important groups of copepods have incorporated diapausing stages into their life histories. In freshwater, estuarine, and coastal environments, species within the Centropagoidea superfamily can produce resting eggs containing embryos that may be quiescent, diapausing, or in some intermediate state. Resting eggs sink into the sediments, remain viable over months to years, and form a reservoir from which the planktonic population is reestablished. In coastal and oceanic environments, copepods within the Calanidae and Eucalanidae families can enter diapause during late juvenile (copepodid) or adult stages. These copepods accumulate large amounts of lipids before they migrate into deep water and diapause for several months. Through respiration, diapausing copepods may sequester more carbon in the deep ocean than any other biogeochemical process, and changes in diapause phenology associated with climate change (particularly reduction in diapause duration) could have a significant impact not only on regional ecosystems, but on global climate as well.},

First, the Arctic is already changing rapidly as a result of climate change. Contemporary warm Arctic temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75\% volume loss) demonstrate climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature increases to near 2 °C will leave the Arctic a much different environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic temperature increase of +4 °C. Second, even under ambitious emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation. Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate. In light of these trends, the precautionary principle calls for early adaptation and mitigation actions.},

	abstract = {The generalized energy budget for fish (i.e., Energy Consumed = Metabolism + Waste + Growth) is as relevant today as when it was first proposed decades ago and serves as a foundational concept in fish biology. Yet, generating accurate measurements of components of the bioenergetics equation in wild fish is a major challenge. How often does a fish eat and what does it consume? How much energy is expended on locomotion? How do human-induced stressors influence energy acquisition and expenditure? Generating answers to these questions is important to fisheries management and to our understanding of adaptation and evolutionary processes. The advent of electronic tags (transmitters and data loggers) has provided biologists with improved opportunities to understand bioenergetics in wild fish. Here, we review the growing diversity of electronic tags with a focus on sensor-equipped devices that are commercially available (e.g., heart rate/electrocardiogram, electromyogram, acceleration, image capture). Next, we discuss each component of the bioenergetics model, recognizing that most research to date has focused on quantifying the activity component of metabolism, and identify ways in which the other, less studied components (e.g., consumption, specific dynamic action component of metabolism, somatic growth, reproductive investment, waste) could be estimated remotely. We conclude with a critical but forward-looking appraisal of the opportunities and challenges in using existing and emerging electronic sensor-tags for the study of fish energetics in the wild. Electronic tagging has become a central and widespread tool in fish ecology and fisheries management; the growing and increasingly affordable toolbox of sensor tags will ensure this trend continues, which will lead to major advances in our understanding of fish biology over the coming decades.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0090294},
	abstract = {Migration is an important event in many animal life histories, but the degree to which individual animals participate in seasonal migrations often varies within populations. The powerful ecological and evolutionary consequences of such partial migration are now well documented, but the underlying mechanisms are still heavily debated. One potential mechanism of partial migration is between-individual variation in body condition, where animals in poor condition cannot pay the costs of migration and hence adopt a resident strategy. However, underlying intrinsic traits may overrule such environmental influence, dictating individual consistency in migratory patterns. Unfortunately, field tests of individual consistency compared to the importance of individual condition on migratory propensity are rare. Here we analyse 6 years of field data on roach migration, gathered by tagging almost 3000 individual fish and monitoring their seasonal migrations over extended periods of time. Our aims were to provide a field test of the role of condition in wild fish for migratory decisions, and also to assess individual consistency in migratory tendency. Our analyses reveal that (1) migratory strategy, in terms of migration/residency, is highly consistent within individuals over time and (2) there is a positive relationship between condition and the probability of migration, but only in individuals that adopt a migratory strategy at some point during their lives. However, life-long residents do not differ in condition to migrants, hence body condition is only a good predictor of migratory tendency in fish with migratory phenotypes and not a more general determinant of migratory tendency for the population. As resident individuals can achieve very high body condition and still remain resident, we suggest that our data provides some of the first field evidence to show that both facultative and obligate strategies can co-exist within populations of migratory animals. © 2014 Brodersen et al.},

	abstract = {Standard metabolic rates ({SMRs}) for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have been calculated independently for different life stages and populations, but the absence of a comprehensive {SMR} model limits its application for modelling the energy use or life stage-specific growth. Atlantic salmon respiration data were compiled from a meta-analysis of 26 publications, and exponential or optimal relationships were fitted to the metadata to estimate respiration equation parameters and generate confidence intervals dependent on temperature and body mass. While model parameters were significant for both models, mass-corrected standard metabolic rates (g O2·day−1) increased as a function of water temperature (°C) and decreased beyond {\textasciitilde}16 °C following an optimal relationship ({AICoptimal} = –9185.50 versus {AICexponential} = –8948.95; ∆{AIC} = 236.55). Juvenile Atlantic salmon growth (cohorts 1 and 2) from bioenergetics simulations did not vary between Little Southwest Miramichi and Northwest Miramichi rivers; however, variation between simulations using the different respiration models (i.e., exponential versus optimal) led to differences in the way fish allocate energy throughout the year. Results from this analysis will inform conservation efforts for the species throughout its current range and predict the energetic requirements at juvenile life stages.},

Our objective was to examine changes in microhabitat selection by age‐0 ({TL} ≤ 85 mm) and age‐1+ ({TL} {\textgreater} 85 mm) Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu from autumn to winter in streams of the southwest Ozark Highlands ecoregion. We examined microhabitat selection (depth, velocity, substrate, cover, and temperature) during autumn 2017 (Spavinaw Creek) and winter 2018 (Spavinaw and Spring creeks). During autumn and winter, age‐0 fish selected intermediate depths of approximately 1 m, whereas age‐1+ fish selected the deepest available habitat. Water depth selection was similar across seasons for both life stages. Both age‐0 and age‐1+ bass selected areas of zero velocity, increasing substrate size, instream cover, and warmwater patches in autumn. Velocity selection differed between autumn and winter with both life stages showing stronger selection of low velocity patches (0.1–0.3 m/s) during winter. Both life stages shifted to having no substrate selection during winter. Age‐1+ bass were more likely than age‐0 bass to use cover during autumn, but this relationship shifted in winter to the age‐0 cohort increasing their selection of cover and the age‐1+ cohort decreasing their selection. Both age‐0 and age‐1+ bass selected relatively warmer habitats during autumn, but not winter. Collectively, our results highlight both seasonal and life stage variation in Smallmouth Bass microhabitat selection. As our understanding of habitat selection across seasons develops, the management of Smallmouth Bass will undoubtedly improve. Changing environmental conditions over time may influence available habitat as well as the timing of seasonal shifts across a range of spatial and temporal scales, including microhabitat patches.},

	title = {Habitat requirements of Atlantic salmon and brown trout in rivers and streams},
	volume = {62},
	abstract = {The distributions and abundances of trout and salmon are strongly influenced by their habitat. The habitat includes both abiotic
and biotic factors, which interact in complex webs. Habitat probably has strongest effects during population bottlenecks,
when the standing stock approaches the carrying capacity of the environment. Various approaches to modelling interactions
between habitat and population density and mean weight have been explored, but further work is needed in this area of investigation.
The importance of depth, current, substrate, cover, and to a lesser extent, temperature and oxygen availability to the
various stages of the life cycles of salmon and trout are briefly reviewed. By drawing on published data, it is possible to define
broad ranges of acceptable conditions for the life stages of each species.However, it is not possible to partition this variation into
between-population differences, within-population preferences, within-population tolerances, and effects of interactions between
habitat variables. To pursue this important issue further, a structured approach using experimentation both in the field and
in suitable laboratory systems is recommended. There is abundant evidence that habitat requirements of salmon and trout overlap.
Trout tend to out-compete salmon except often in areas of particularly fast flows and, perhaps, remote from the river bank.
The habitat requirements of year classes of salmon and trout overlap and therefore, there is scope for interactions between them
depending on the spatial arrangement of habitats and the occurrence of bottlenecks. It is particularly important to understand
where the bottlenecks to production lie and to focus on these in the first instance. Otherwise, there is a risk of manipulating habitat
that is already in excess, or increasing numbers of a population that will subsequently be constrained, e.g., by over-wintering
habitat. For this reason, it is prudent to accept that although manipulations of habitat may appear to be beneficial when considered
locally, they should be measured and assessed where possible in terms of the production of returning adults and/or high
quality smolts. Because of the complexity of interactions between salmon, trout, and the animals that eat them, it is at present
difficult, or impossible, to derive good predictive models of the effects of manipulating habitats under many circumstances.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Sympatric populations of native Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis and naturalized Brown Trout Salmo trutta exist throughout the eastern {USA}. An understanding of habitat use by sympatric populations is of importance for fisheries management agencies because of the close association between habitat and population dynamics. Moreover, habitat use by stream-dwelling salmonids may be further complicated by several factors, including the potential for fish to display scale-dependent habitat use. Discrete-choice models were used to (1) evaluate fall and early winter daytime habitat use by sympatric Brook Trout and Brown Trout populations based on available residual pool habitat within a stream network and (2) assess the sensitivity of inferred habitat use to changes in the spatial scale of the assumed available habitat. Trout exhibited an overall preference for pool habitats over nonpool habitats; however, the use of pools was nonlinear over time. Brook Trout displayed a greater preference for deep residual pool habitats than for shallow pool and nonpool habitats, whereas Brown Trout selected for all pool habitat categories similarly. Habitat use by both species was found to be scale dependent. At the smallest spatial scale (50 m), habitat use was primarily related to the time of year and fish weight. However, at larger spatial scales (250 and 450 m), habitat use varied over time according to the study stream in which a fish was located. Scale-dependent relationships in seasonal habitat use by Brook Trout and Brown Trout highlight the importance of considering scale when attempting to make inferences about habitat use; fisheries managers may want to consider identifying the appropriate spatial scale when devising actions to restore and protect Brook Trout populations and their habitats.

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.2307/2269561},
	abstract = {Population declines are often caused by multiple factors, including anthropogenic ones that can be mitigated or reversed to enhance population recovery. We used a size-classified matrix population model to examine multiple anthropogenic effects on a population and determine which factors are most (or least) important to population dynamics. We modeled brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in southern Appalachian mountain streams responding to multiple anthropogenic effects including the introduction of an exotic salmonid species (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss), a decrease in {pH} (through acidic deposition), an increase in siltation (from roadbuilding and logging), and an increase in fishing pressure. Potential brook trout responses to rainbow trout include a decrease in survival rate of small fish, a change in density dependence in survival of small fish, and a decrease in growth rates of all sizes. When we included these responses in the population model, we found that population size tended to decrease with an increase in small-fish growth rate (producing a population with fewer, but larger, fish). In addition, changes in patterns of density-dependent survival also had a strong impact on both population size and size structure. Brook trout respond to decreases in {pH} with decreased growth rate in all size classes, decreased survival rates of small fish, and decreased egg-to-larva survival rates. This combination of effects, at magnitudes documented in laboratory experiments, had severe negative impacts on the modeled population. If siltation effects were severe, the extreme increase in egg-to-larva mortality could have strong negative effects on the population. However, even very strong increases in large fish mortality associated with sport harvesting were not likely to cause a local extinction. In all of these cases, the interaction of drastic changes in population size structure with randomly occurring floods or droughts may lead to even stronger negative impacts than those predicted from the deterministic model. Because these fish can reproduce at a small size, negative impacts on survival of the largest fish were not detrimental to the persistence of the population. Because survival of small juveniles is density dependent, even moderate decreases in survival in this stage had little effect on the ultimate population size. In general, a brook trout population will respond most negatively to factors that decrease survival of large juveniles and small adults, and growth rates of small juveniles.},

	abstract = {For many ectothermic animals, the acquisition, storage and depletion of lipids is integral to successfully coping with reduced metabolic rates and activity levels associated with cold, winter periods. In fish, lipids are crucial for overwinter survival and successful reproduction. The timing and magnitude of seasonal lipid storage should therefore vary predictably among fish with different thermal preferences and spawn times. Small- and large-bodied fish should also face different constraints associated with season that influence lipid cycling. However, much work to date has been species- and location-specific and a general conceptual model for the seasonal energy budgets of freshwater fish is lacking. Here, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of seasonal lipid levels in freshwater fishes. We predicted that warm and cool water species would be more likely to demonstrate peak lipid levels during warm months than cold water species, and expected a larger magnitude of annual lipid cycling in warm and cool water compared to cold water fish. We also expected dampened lipid cycling in larger fish due to their lower mass-specific metabolic rates. Observed patterns in the timing and magnitude of lipid storage contradicted our prediction because lipid cycling was widespread across species, despite thermal guild, with peak lipid levels commonly occurring during warmer months, even in cold water fish. For body size effects, larger bodied fish species had dampened seasonal lipid cycling, as predicted. We developed a conceptual framework describing how the ‘scope’ for variation in annual lipid cycling changes with body size both among and within species in order to guide future work. Together, our findings suggest that energy acquired during warm months is broadly important for overwinter survival and reproduction in fishes, and provide a new perspective on the differential constraints and physiological responses to seasonality among freshwater fish. Improving our understanding of these dynamics is especially pressing given that a changing global climate is anticipated to alter existing seasonal signals.},

	abstract = {This publication provides an historical review and evaluation of documented ecological effects associated with salmonine introductions to the Laurentian Great Lakes. The introduction of salmonines to the Great Lakes date back to the 1870s, when natural populations of native salmonines in the Great Lakes (e.g., lake charr, brook charr, Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario) were in severe decline. Using newly developed hatchery technology, American and Canadian agencies released several non-native salmonines into the Great Lakes during the early era (187-1960) of introductions. With the exception of brown trout and rainbow trout in some tributaries, the early introductions failed to establish self-sustaining populations. Beginning in the mid-1960s, American and Canadian fisheries agencies began another intensive round of salmonine introductions to the Great Lakes that included brown trout, rainbow trout, chinook salmon, coho salmon and kokanee. The original objectives for these introductions were (1) to develop self-sustaining, wild-reproducing populations to exert biological control of nuisance alewife and rainbow smelt and/or (2) to develop new recreational fisheries. Chinook and coho salmon especially thrived on the abundant forage base in the open waters of the Great Lakes, and triggered a dramatic eruption of recreational salmon fishing. Since the 1960s introductions of salmonines to the Great Lakes increased dramatically, with estimates of total stocking in excess of 745 million fish for the period 1966-1998, an average of more than 61,000 non-native fish released every day for 33 years. In many cases, populations of introduced salmonines were heavily stocked beyond levels of reproduction observed in the wild, primarily to support the put-grow-and-take recreational fisheries. One of the most dramatic effects that introductions have had on the non-native salmonines is the alteration of their life-history characteristics, including body form and function, feeding and spawning behaviour. Over time, fisheries managers changed their perception of alewife/rainbow smelt from a nuisance to an important prey resource that must be protected to support the recreational salmon fishery. A review of scientific literature and technical reports from the past four decades was undertaken to evaluate the ecological effects of introduced salmonines on the Great Lakes ecosystem. Using established evaluation protocols, it was determined that there is evidence of significant ecological effects in six different categories: (1)diseases and parasites, (2) predation on native species, (3) competition for limiting resources, (4) genetic alteration, (5) environmental alteration and (6) community alteration. Taken together, this body of evidence supports the conclusion that the ongoing introduction of non-native salmonines poses an ecologically-significant risk to the Great Lakes ecosystem and its native organisms, and that the introductions should be terminated.},

	abstract = {This review and data analysis outline how fish biologists should most reliably estimate the minimal amount of oxygen needed by a fish to support its aerobic metabolic rate (termed standard metabolic rate; {SMR}). By reviewing key literature, it explains the theory, terminology and challenges underlying {SMR} measurements in fishes, which are almost always made using respirometry (which measures oxygen uptake, M˙O2). Then, the practical difficulties of measuring {SMR} when activity of the fish is not quantitatively evaluated are comprehensively explored using 85 examples of M˙O2 data from different fishes and one crustacean, an analysis that goes well beyond any previous attempt. The main objective was to compare eight methods to estimate {SMR}. The methods were: average of the lowest 10 values (low10) and average of the 10\% lowest M˙O2 values, after removing the five lowest ones as outliers (low10\%), mean of the lowest normal distribution ({MLND}) and quantiles that assign from 10 to 30\% of the data below {SMR} (q0·1, q0·15, q0·2, q0·25 and q0·3). The eight methods yielded significantly different {SMR} estimates, as expected. While the differences were small when the variability was low amongst the M˙O2 values, they were important ({\textgreater}20\%) for several cases. The degree of agreement between the methods was related to the c.v. of the observations that were classified into the lowest normal distribution, the c.v. {MLND} (C.V.{MLND}). When this indicator was low (≤5·4), it was advantageous to use the {MLND}, otherwise, one of the q0·2 or q0·25 should be used. The second objective was to assess if the data recorded during the initial recovery period in the respirometer should be included or excluded, and the recommendation is to exclude them. The final objective was to determine the minimal duration of experiments aiming to estimate {SMR}. The results show that 12 h is insufficient but 24 h is adequate. A list of basic recommendations for practitioners who use respirometry to measure {SMR} in fishes is provided.},

Automating the procedure with easily available hardware and software further reduces error by allowing many measurements to be made over long periods thereby minimizing animal stress due to acclimation issues. This paper describes some of the fundamental principles that need to be considered when designing and carrying out automated intermittent-flow respirometry (e.g. chamber size, flush rate, flush time, chamber mixing, measurement periods and temperature control).

To determine which prey organisms are important in sustaining brook trout populations, we monitored the feeding patterns of a population of brook trout over the course of 2 years with an emphasis on seasonal change. We employed a bioenergetics model to estimate whether or not each fish had obtained enough energy to meet daily metabolic demand. As a result, qualitative comparisons between fish feeding above maintenance ration (successfully feeding fish) and fish feeding below maintenance ration (unsuccessfully feeding fish) were possible. With the exception of winter, brook trout derived significantly more energy from terrestrial organisms than aquatic organisms. During each season, successfully feeding brook trout fed on greater proportions of specific prey types. Terrestrial Coleoptera and Lepidoptera consistently proved to be important prey during warmer seasons, while large organisms such as vertebrates and crayfish appeared to be important during winter. Our findings suggest that terrestrial organisms are more important than aquatic organisms in sustaining brook trout populations. Further, certain large and abundant terrestrial taxa are critical in providing energy to brook trout. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The maxima in numbers occur synchronously in North America and Europe, and probably all round the arctic regions.The varying hare in Canada has a period of 10 to 11 years.5. The only regular periods shown by the animals dealt with are the short one of 3[1/2] years and the longer one of 10 to 11 years. The former is probably more marked in the arctic and the other further south.6. The sandgrouse p.f. point to the existence of an 11-year climatic cycle in the deserts of Central Asia.7. The effects of these p.f. on evolution must be very great, although at present problematical; but the following suggestions are made :--(a) Natural selection of some characters must be periodic.(b) There will be different types of natural selection at the maxima and minima of numbers.(c) The struggle for existence, and therefore natural selection, tend to cease temporarily during the rapid expansion in numbers from a minimum, and new mutations have then a chance to get established and spread, i.e. without the aid of natural selection. This might happen only rarely.(d) This would explain the origin and survival of non adaptive characters in a species.(e) On the other hand periodic reduction in numbers will act as an important factor causing uniformity in the species.(f) The opposing factors (c) and (e) will vary much in different species, and the problem will require the combined attentions of mathematicians, and of ecologists working on the methods of regulation of the numbers of animals.(g) This mechanical uniformity factor, since it acts independently of natural selection, explains how a particular structure or habit may evolve, when it only has a general adaptive significance.},

The Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea is the epitome of such behavior; despite its small size ({\textless}125 g), banding recoveries and at-sea surveys suggest that its annual migration from boreal and high Arctic breeding grounds to the Southern Ocean may be the longest seasonal movement of any animal. Our tracking of 11 Arctic terns fitted with miniature (1.4-g) geolocators revealed that these birds do indeed travel huge distances (more than 80,000 km annually for some individuals). As well as confirming the location of the main wintering region, we also identified a previously unknown oceanic stopover area in the North Atlantic used by birds from at least two breeding populations (from Greenland and Iceland). Although birds from the same colony took one of two alternative southbound migration routes following the African or South American coast, all returned on a broadly similar, sigmoidal trajectory, crossing from east to west in the Atlantic in the region of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone. Arctic terns clearly target regions of high marine productivity both as stopover and wintering areas, and exploit prevailing global wind systems to reduce flight costs on long-distance commutes.},

The decoupling of phenological relationships will have important ramifications for trophic interactions, altering food-web structures and leading to eventual ecosystem-level changes. Temperate marine environments may be particularly vulnerable to these changes because the recruitment success of higher trophic levels is highly dependent on synchronization with pulsed planktonic production.Using long-term data of 66 plankton taxa during the period from 1958 to 2002, we investigated whether climate warming signals4 are emergent across all trophic levels and functional groups within an ecological community.

However, reproduction is initiated much earlier than the time of maximum food requirement of the offspring. Individuals should therefore start reproduction in response to cues (the proximate factors), available in the environment of reproductive decision making, which predict the later environment of selection. With increasing spring temperatures over the past decades, vegetation phenology has advanced, with a concomitant advancement in the reproduction of some species at higher trophic levels. However, a mismatch between food abundance and offspring needs may occur if changes in the environment of decision making do not match those in the environment of selection. Date of egg laying in a great tit (Parus major) population has not advanced over a 23-year period, but selection for early laying has intensified. We believe that this is the first documented case of an adaptive response being hampered because a changing abiotic factor affects the environment in which a reproductive decision is made differently from the environment in which selection occurs.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.212519399},
	abstract = {Climatologists tell us that Earth's climate is changing (1): It currently seems clear that a warmer climate is developing in the northern hemisphere, and that the weather will become more variable (2, 3). As part of this global change, seasonal patterns are being altered to make spring conditions occur earlier in the year in the north (4), without necessarily corresponding changes in more southern latitudes (5). We know much less about the ecological effects of such climate changes. Studying recent changes (6) and fluctuations (7) over the last few decades may help us improve our understanding of ecological responses to climate changes. This is the approach taken by Winkler et al. (8), in this issue of {PNAS}, in their study of the consequences of climate-induced shifts in breeding date on one of the most important life history traits in birds: clutch size (8). Their contribution adds to a rapidly growing literature on ecology–climate interactions (6, 7). Phenology, a key feature in the article by Winkler et al. (8), is the study of seasonal plant and animal activity driven by environmental factors (4). The phenology of a species is typically evolved through natural selection to match the environmental conditions to maximize its fitness (9). In the temperate region, reproduction in birds starts in late spring or early summer, although timing often varies depending on climate. The effect of climate on the phenology, and in particular the timing of reproduction, is well known for plants, amphibians, and birds (10–12). These studies have demonstrated that onset of reproduction in spring may have advanced by a week or two due to recent changes in climate over much of North America and Europe (6, 7). We know much less about the implications of such phenological changes on the population dynamics of the species. Winkler et al. (8) are among the first to ask: (i) what are the consequences of earlier egg-laying on demographic rates (such as clutch size and survival)? (ii) To what extent do phenological changes in one species match changes in the rest of the environment? (iii) Finally, are the relationships between climate, phenology, and other life history traits simply linear, or are these relationships nonlinear? Here we highlight these three issues and suggest a more general framework, within which such ecological responses to climate change might be studied.},

	abstract = {Tropical forest ecosystems are large stores of carbon which supply millions of people with life support requirements. Currently tropical forests are undergoing massive deforestation. Here, I address the possible impact of global change conditions, including elevated {CO}2, temperature rise, and nitrogen deposition on forest structure and dynamics. Tropical forests may be particularly susceptible to climate change for the following reasons: (1) Phenological events (such as flowering and fruiting) are highly tuned to climatic conditions. Thus a small change in climate can have a major impact on the forest, its biological diversity and its role in the carbon cycle. (2) There are strong coevolutionary interactions, such as pollination seed dispersal, with a high degree of specialization, i.e., only certain animals can effect these activities for certain species. Global change can decouple these tight coevolutionary interactions. (3) Because of high species diversity per unit area, species of the tropical rain forest must have narrow niches. Thus changes in global climate can eliminate species and therefore reduce biological diversity. (4) Deforestation and other forms of disturbance may have significant feedback on hydrology both regionally and globally. The predicted decline in the rainfall in the Amazon Basin and the intensification of the Indian monsoon can have a large effect on water availability and floods which are already devastating low-lying areas. It is concluded that tropical forests may be very sensitive to climate change. Under climatic change conditions their structure and function may greatly change, their integrity may be violated and their services to people may be greatly modified. Because they are large stores of great biological diversity, they require immediate study before it is too late. The study requires the collaboration of scientists with a wide range of backgrounds and experiences including biologists, climate modellers, atmospheric scientists, economists, human demographers and sociologists in order to carry out holistic and urgently needed work. Global climatic change brings a great challenge to science and to policy makers.},

	volume = {94},

	abstract = {This paper advances an hypothesis that the primary adaptive driver of seasonal migration is maintenance of site fidelity to familiar breeding locations. We argue that seasonal migration is therefore principally an adaptation for geographic persistence when confronted with seasonality – analogous to hibernation, freeze tolerance, or other organismal adaptations to cyclically fluctuating environments. These ideas stand in contrast to traditional views that bird migration evolved as an adaptive dispersal strategy for exploiting new breeding areas and avoiding competitors. Our synthesis is supported by a large body of research on avian breeding biology that demonstrates the reproductive benefits of breeding-site fidelity. Conceptualizing migration as an adaptation for persistence places new emphasis on understanding the evolutionary trade-offs between migratory behaviour and other adaptations to fluctuating environments both within and across species. Seasonality-induced departures from breeding areas, coupled with the reproductive benefits of maintaining breeding-site fidelity, also provide a mechanism for explaining the evolution of migration that is agnostic to the geographic origin of migratory lineages (i.e. temperate or tropical). Thus, our framework reconciles much of the conflict in previous research on the historical biogeography of migratory species. Although migratory behaviour and geographic range change fluidly and rapidly in many populations, we argue that the loss of plasticity for migration via canalization is an overlooked aspect of the evolutionary dynamics of migration and helps explain the idiosyncratic distributions and migratory routes of long-distance migrants. Our synthesis, which revolves around the insight that migratory organisms travel long distances simply to stay in the same place, provides a necessary evolutionary context for understanding historical biogeographic patterns in migratory lineages as well as the ecological dynamics of migratory connectivity between breeding and non-breeding locations.},

In the present study, we investigate the link between environmental sensitivity assessed globally (revealed by phenotypic variation in body weight) and more targeted physiological and behavioral indicators that are generally used to assess the sensitivity of a fish to environmental stressors. We took advantage of original biological material, the rainbow trout isogenic lines, which allowed the disentangling of the genetic and environmental parts of the phenotypic variance. Ten lines were characterized for the changes of body weight variability (weight measurements taken every month during 18 months), the plasma cortisol response to confinement stress (3 challenges) and a set of selected behavioral indicators. This study unambiguously demonstrated the existence of genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity, with some lines being particularly sensitive to environmental fluctuations and others rather insensitive. Correlations between coefficient of variation ({CV}) for body weight and behavioral and physiological traits were observed. This confirmed that {CV} for body weight could be used as an indicator of environmental sensitivity. As the relationship between indicators ({CV} weight, risk-taking, exploration and cortisol) was shown to be likely depending on the nature and intensity of the stressor, the joint use of several indicators should help to investigate the biological complexity of environmental sensitivity.},

We then compared the slopes of the thermal reaction norms among populations. The 16-22°C part of the reaction norms for developmental rate was flatter (more canalized) for the temperate populations than for the tropical populations. However, slopes for the reaction norms of the two morphological traits (wing size, wing:thorax ratio), were steeper (more plastic) in the temperate versus the tropical populations over the entire thermal range.

	volume = {23},
	doi = {10.1111/gcb.13684},
	abstract = {Arctic amplification, the accelerated climate warming in the polar regions, is causing a more rapid advancement of the onset of spring in the Arctic than in temperate regions. Consequently, the arrival of many migratory birds in the Arctic is thought to become increasingly mismatched with the onset of local spring, consequently reducing individual fitness and potentially even population levels. We used a dynamic state variable model to study whether Arctic long-distance migrants can advance their migratory schedules under climate warming scenarios which include Arctic amplification, and whether such an advancement is constrained by fuel accumulation or the ability to anticipate climatic changes. Our model predicts that barnacle geese Branta leucopsis suffer from considerably reduced reproductive success with increasing Arctic amplification through mistimed arrival, when they cannot anticipate a more rapid progress of Arctic spring from their wintering grounds. When geese are able to anticipate a more rapid progress of Arctic spring, they are predicted to advance their spring arrival under Arctic amplification up to 44 days without any reproductive costs in terms of optimal condition or timing of breeding. Negative effects of mistimed arrival on reproduction are predicted to be somewhat mitigated by increasing summer length under warming in the Arctic, as late arriving geese can still breed successfully. We conclude that adaptation to Arctic amplification may rather be constrained by the (un)predictability of changes in the Arctic spring than by the time available for fuel accumulation. Social migrants like geese tend to have a high behavioural plasticity regarding stopover site choice and migration schedule, giving them the potential to adapt to future climate changes on their flyway.},

	abstract = {Recent changes in the seasonal timing (phenology) of familiar biological events have been one of the most conspicuous signs of climate change. However, the lack of a standardized approach to analysing change has hampered assessment of consistency in such changes among different taxa and trophic levels and across freshwater, terrestrial and marine environments. We present a standardized assessment of 25532 rates of phenological change for 726 {UK} terrestrial, freshwater and marine taxa. The majority of spring and summer events have advanced, and more rapidly than previously documented. Such consistency is indicative of shared large scale drivers. Furthermore, average rates of change have accelerated in a way that is consistent with observed warming trends. Less coherent patterns in some groups of organisms point to the agency of more local scale processes and multiple drivers. For the first time we show a broad scale signal of differential phenological change among trophic levels; across environments advances in timing were slowest for secondary consumers, thus heightening the potential risk of temporal mismatch in key trophic interactions. If current patterns and rates of phenological change are indicative of future trends, future climate warming may exacerbate trophic mismatching, further disrupting the functioning, persistence and resilience of many ecosystems and having a major impact on ecosystem services. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0803825105},
	abstract = {Recent rapid climatic changes are associated with dramatic changes in phenology of plants and animals, with optimal timing of reproduction advancing considerably in the northern hemisphere. However, some species may not have advanced their timing of breeding sufficiently to continue reproducing optimally relative to the occurrence of peak food availability, thus becoming mismatched compared with their food sources. The degree of mismatch may differ among species, and species with greater mismatch may be characterized by declining populations. Here we relate changes in spring migration timing by 100 European bird species since 1960, considered as an index of the phenological response of bird species to recent climate change, to their population trends. Species that declined in the period 1990-2000 did not advance their spring migration, whereas those with stable or increasing populations advanced their migration considerably. On the other hand, population trends during 1970-1990 were predicted by breeding habitat type, northernmost breeding latitude, and winter range (with species of agricultural habitat, breeding at northern latitudes, and wintering in Africa showing an unfavorable conservation status), but not by change in migration timing. The association between population trend in 1990-2000 and change in migration phenology was not confounded by any of the previously identified predictors of population trends in birds, or by similarity in phenotype among taxa due to common descent. Our findings imply that ecological factors affecting population trends can change over time and suggest that ongoing climatic changes will increasingly threaten vulnerable migratory bird species, augmenting their extinction risk. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

Concomitant with such large abiotic changes, biological responses to warming at high northern latitudes are also expected to outpace those at lower latitudes. One of the clearest and most rapid signals of biological response to rising temperatures across an array of biomes has been shifts in species phenology [2-4], yet to date evidence for phenological responses to climate change has been presented from most biomes except the High Arctic [3]. Given the well-established consequences for population dynamics of shifts in the timing of life history events [5,6], it is essential that the High Arctic be represented in assessments of phenological response to climate change. Using the most comprehensive data set available from this region, we document extremely rapid climate-induced advancement of flowering, emergence and egg-laying in a wide array of species in a high-arctic ecosystem. The strong responses and the large variability within species and taxa illustrate how easily biological interactions may be disrupted by abiotic forcing, and how dramatic responses to climatic changes can be for arctic ecosystems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {As an apparent adaptation to predictably long episodes of fasting, the sit-and-wait foraging Burmese python experiences unprecedented regulation of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular performance with feeding and fasting. The ingestion of a meal signals the quiescent gut tissues to start secreting digestive acid and enzymes, to upregulate intestinal brush-border enzymes and nutrient transporters, and to grow. An integrated phenomenon, digestion is also characterized by increases in the mass, and presumably the function, of the heart, pancreas, liver and kidneys. Once digestion is complete, the python's stomach and small intestine rapidly downregulate performance. Much of the modulation of intestinal function can be explained by the 5-fold increase in microvillus length and apical surface area with feeding, and the subsequent shortening of the microvilli after digestion has finished. Digestion for the Burmese python is a relatively expensive endeavor, evident by the as much as a 44-fold increase in metabolic rate and equivalent in cost to as much as 37\% of the meal's energy. Their large metabolic response is supported by substantial increases in ventilation and cardiac output and the apparent catabolism of glucose and lipids. Unmatched in the magnitude of its numerous physiological responses to feeding, the Burmese python is a very attractive model for examining the capacities and regulatory mechanisms of physiological performance.},

This study considers the Gulf of Maine ecosystem, a region of high social and ecological importance in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and synthesizes current knowledge of (a) key seasonal processes, patterns, and events; (b) direct evidence for shifts in timing; (c) implications of phenological responses for linked ecological-human systems; and (d) potential phenology-focused adaptation strategies and actions. Twenty studies demonstrated shifts in timing of regional marine organisms and seasonal environmental events. The most common response was earlier timing, observed in spring onset, spring and winter hydrology, zooplankton abundance, occurrence of several larval fishes, and diadromous fish migrations. Later timing was documented for fall onset, reproduction and fledging in Atlantic puffins, spring and fall phytoplankton blooms, and occurrence of additional larval fishes. Changes in event duration generally increased and were detected in zooplankton peak abundance, early life history periods of macro-invertebrates, and lobster fishery landings. Reduced duration was observed in winter–spring ice-affected stream flows. Two studies projected phenological changes, both finding diapause duration would decrease in zooplankton under future climate scenarios. Phenological responses were species-specific and varied depending on the environmental driver, spatial, and temporal scales evaluated. Overall, a wide range of baseline phenology and relevant modeling studies exist, yet surprisingly few document long-term shifts. Results reveal a need for increased emphasis on phenological shifts in the Gulf of Maine and identify opportunities for future research and consideration of phenological changes in adaptation efforts.},

This model is integrated from a simple bioenergetics model; re-examining the link between von Bertalanffy growth and bioenergetics will help predict how environmental and demographic rates influence growth rates over time. In this paper, we discuss how a simple bioenergetics model can help predict density dependent growth and demonstrate how to incorporate environmental drivers into the {VBGF} based on the original bioenergetics model. Finally, we discuss difficulties and pitfalls in linking environmental and demographic variation to changes in growth.},

	abstract = {Avian long-distance migration involves the storage and expenditure of very large loads. Birds may double in weight before take-off on flights of many 1000 km, they may lose half their body mass over the subsequent few days that such trips Recent studies indicate that in addition to the storage and depletion of fat, muscles and belly organs also undergo considerable changes in size in the course such migrations. Such intraindividual and repeatedly reversed changes in stores organ sizes represent a class of phenotypic plasticity called 'phenotypic flexibility'. Using preliminary comparative data for different populations of Bar-tailed Godwits Limosa lapponica, and several other shorebird species adding variation to migration strategies sampled (Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria, Ruff Philomachus pugnax, Red Knot Calidris canutus and Bristle-thighed Curlew Numenius tahitiensis), the thesis is developed that the size of the organs carried during take-off represent evolutionary compromises between their functions during the storage, flight post-arrival phases of migration. In all cases fat-free tissue along with fat is deposited during fuel storage, but the proportions vary a great deal between similarly species. Just before departure on long-distance flights, exercise organs (pectoral muscle and heart) tend to show hypertrophy and nutritional organs (stomach, intestine and liver) tend to show atrophy. Reductions in nutritional organs appear most pronounced in (sub-) species that are about to overfly barren oceans with or no opportunities for emergency landings. Migrant birds seem to show a great of adaptive flexibility, and the study of this flexibility may shed light on (presently unknown) physiological mechanisms as well as on correlated ecological constraints on bird migration},

Two populations of blue tits (Parus caeruleus) that breed at different dates in similar, but spatially distinct, habitat types in Corsica and southern France provide a unique opportunity to quantify the energetic and fitness consequences when breeding is mismatched with local productivity. As food supply and demand become progressively mismatched, the increased cost of rearing young pushes the metabolic effort of adults beyond their apparent sustainable limit, drastically reducing the persistence of adults in the breeding population. We provide evidence that the economics of parental foraging and. limits to sustainable metabolic effort are key selective forces underlying synchronized seasonal breeding and long-term shifts in breeding date in response to climatic change.},

	abstract = {Temperature is one of the most influential drivers of physiological performance and behaviour in ectotherms, determining how these animals relate to their ecosystems and their ability to succeed in particular habitats. Here, we analysed the largest set of acceleration data compiled to date for elasmobranchs to examine the relationship between volitional activity and temperature in 252 individuals from 8 species. We calculated activation energies for the thermal performance response in each species and estimated optimum temperatures using an Arrhenius breakpoint analysis, subsequently fitting thermal performance curves to the activity data. Juveniles living in confined nursery habitats not only spent substantially more time above their optimum temperature and at the upper limits of their performance breadths compared to larger, less site-restricted animals, but also showed lower activation energies and broader performance curves. Species or life stages occupying confined habitats featured more generalist behavioural responses to temperature change, whereas wider ranging elasmobranchs were characterised by more specialist behavioural responses. The relationships between the estimated performance regimes and environmental temperature limits suggest that animals in confined habitats, including many juvenile elasmobranchs within nursery habitats, are likely to experience a reduction of performance under a warming climate, although their flatter thermal response will likely dampen this impact. The effect of warming on less site-restricted species is difficult to forecast since three of four species studied here did not reach their optimum temperature in the wild, although their specialist performance characteristics may indicate a more rapid decline should optimum temperatures be exceeded.},

Processes leading to the selection of a home range, therefore, potentially have an important bearing on individual fitness and, ultimately, on population structure. In this study, movements associated with the establishment of home ranges by golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in an Australian lowland river were examined using radiotelemetry. To examine behaviour associated with exploration and settlement into new home ranges, fish were artificially translocated into an unfamiliar river section. Although there was substantial intraspecific variation in patterns of movement, all fish tracked over the entire study period eventually settled into restricted home ranges. Several fish of both species either moved away from established home ranges and settled in new areas, or undertook large-scale movements and subsequently returned to the original home range. It is suggested that such movements may provide a mechanism by which fish can reap the benefits of home-range occupation whilst still being able to respond to changes in the distributions of spatially and temporally dynamic resources. © 2004 {NRC} Canada.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, ecologists have witnessed vast improvements in our ability to collect animal movement data through animal-borne technology, such as through {GPS} or {ARGOS} systems. However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of {GPS}/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, {GPS} devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from {GPS}/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

	volume = {73},
	doi = {10.1139/b95-020},
	abstract = {Unlike the marked temperature-related periodicity of temperate forests, development tends to be continuous in aseasonal lowland tropical rain forests and becomes more episodic in response to increasing annual drought in tropical dry forests. Hence, in tropical rain forests, foliar development (production, senescence, and longevity) is largely under internal rather than environmental control. Tropical forests with marked annual dry seasons display associated seasonality of leaf production and shedding. This developmental seasonality can be explained by overlaying the influence of seasonality on trees' internally regulated development and appears to be controlled by acclimative physiological processes and not by sensitivity to photo-, thermo-periodic, or direct environmental cues. Consequences of tropical phenology stem from both the variety of leaf and species ecophysiological types common to a given moisture regime and their relative synchrony of development, and include larger diversity of ecophysiological species types in rain than dry forests; differential rates of herbivory in dry than wet seasons and for synchronous versus asynchronous leaf flushes; ecosystems with greater canopy foliar mass per hectare in rain than dry forests; and several leaf adaptations perhaps unique to tropical forests, such as delayed greening and seasonal leaf phenotypes. Phenology of rain forests should change little unless water balance changes markedly, and developmental events in rain forests may be relatively insensitive to moderate changes in {CO}2or temperature. Phenology of dry forests could be more sensitive, and in opposite directions, to elevated {CO}2and temperatures. Elevated {CO}2might delay onset of leaf shedding and stimulate longer life span if stand level transpiration is reduced, whereas higher temperatures could lead to more rapid water depletion, longer leafless periods, and more strongly synchronized phenology. -from Author},

The model quantifies the fitness loss for organisms failing to time behaviours optimally. We decompose the immediate change in fitness resulting from environmental changes into a component that is due to changes in the predictive power of the cue and a component that derives from the mismatch of the old response to the cue to the new environmental conditions. Our results show that consequences may range from negative, neutral to positive and are highly dependent on how cue and optimal timing and their relation are specifically affected by environmental changes. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/{CNRS}.},

	abstract = {We examined the effects of river environment on the timing of spawning migrations by anadromous Pacific lamprey, Lampetra tridentata, in the Columbia River (U.S.A.). In a 41-year time series of adult lamprey counts, migration timing was earliest in warm, low-discharge years and latest in cold, high-flow years. Threshold temperatures associated with run timing were similar throughout the dataset despite significant impoundment-related warming, suggesting that temperature-dependent migration cues have been temporally stable. Within each year, migration rates of {PIT}-tagged lampreys were positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with discharge through multiple river reaches, offering additional evidence for environmental control of upstream movement. Both visual count and {PIT}-tag data indicated that there may be population-based differences in migration timing within the aggregate Columbia River lamprey run. These life history and behavioral results have potentially far-reaching implications for management of lamprey species. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The Arctic region has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average-a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. The rapid Arctic warming has contributed to dramatic melting of Arctic sea ice and spring snow cover, at a pace greater than that simulated by climate models. These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent extreme weather events across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, including severe winters. The possibility of a link between Arctic change and mid-latitude weather has spurred research activities that reveal three potential dynamical pathways linking Arctic amplification to mid-latitude weather: changes in storm tracks, the jet stream, and planetary waves and their associated energy propagation. Through changes in these key atmospheric features, it is possible, in principle, for sea ice and snow cover to jointly influence mid-latitude weather. However, because of incomplete knowledge of how high-latitude climate change influences these phenomena, combined with sparse and short data records, and imperfect models, large uncertainties regarding the magnitude of such an influence remain. We conclude that improved process understanding, sustained and additional Arctic observations, and better coordinated modelling studies will be needed to advance our understanding of the influences on mid-latitude weather and extreme events. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {Vegetation phenology is highly sensitive to climate change. Phenology also controls many feedbacks of vegetation to the climate system by influencing the seasonality of albedo, surface roughness length, canopy conductance, and fluxes of water, energy, {CO}2 and biogenic volatile organic compounds. In this review, we first discuss the environmental drivers of phenology, and the impacts of climate change on phenology, in different biomes. We then examine the vegetation-climate feedbacks that are mediated by phenology, and assess the potential impact on these feedbacks of shifts in phenology driven by climate change. We finish with an overview of phenological modeling and we suggest ways in which models might be improved using existing data sets. Several key weaknesses in our current understanding emerge from this analysis. First, we need a better understanding of the drivers of phenology, particularly in under-studied biomes (e.g. tropical forests). We do not have a mechanistic understanding of the role of photoperiod, even in well-studied biomes. In all biomes, the factors controlling senescence and dormancy are not well-documented. Second, for the most part (i.e. with the exception of phenology impacts on {CO}2 exchange) we have only a qualitative understanding of the feedbacks between vegetation and climate that are mediated by phenology. We need to quantify the magnitude of these feedbacks, and ensure that they are accurately reproduced by models. Third, we need to work towards a new understanding of phenological processes that enables progress beyond the modeling paradigms currently in use. Accurate representation of phenological processes in models that couple the land surface to the climate system is particularly important, especially when such models are being used to predict future climate. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We review literature concerning the impacts of climate change on the migration of marine species, with an emphasis on the adaptation of migration phenology through genetic tracking and phenotypic plasticity. We then develop an individual-based modeling framework characterizing the effects of climate change on phenology and population dynamics. In the framework, an animal's ability to match its environmental preferences, its bioclimate envelope, to the environmental conditions by adjusting its migration timing between foraging and breeding habitats determines its condition, survival, and fecundity. Climate-induced changes in the envelope produce timing mismatches that result in a population adapting its phenology through both genetic and plastic processes. Model results suggest: (1) the temporal size of the bioclimate envelope is an important determinant of a population's sensitivity to climate change and susceptibility to extinction, (2) population extinction can occur if the rate of change in the timing of the envelope exceeds the rate its phenology changes or if the variability in the envelope exceeds the population's inherent capacity for variability, (3) a population with migration timing cued by photoperiod is expected to exhibit weaker phenotypic plasticity than one cued by temperature, and (4) population extinction in response to climate change follows a threshold pattern such that population size may not be a reliable indicator of extinction threat, although variability in average individual condition across years may be an extinction threat indicator. Finally, while the model is intentionally simplistic, we discuss how it can be extended to cover more complex interactions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Phenology refers to the periodic appearance of life-cycle events and currently receives abundant attention as the effects of global change on phenology are so apparent. Phenology as a discipline observes these events and relates their annual variation to variation in climate. But phenology is also studied in other disciplines, each with their own perspective. Evolutionary ecologists study variation in seasonal timing and its fitness consequences, whereas chronobiologists emphasize the periodic nature of life-cycle stages and their underlying timing programmes (e.g. circannual rhythms). The (neuro-) endocrine processes underlying these life-cycle events are studied by physi-ologists and need to be linked to genes that are explored by molecular geneticists. In order to fully understand variation in phenology, we need to integrate these different perspectives, in particular by combining evolutionary and mechanistic approaches. We use avian research to characterize different perspectives and to highlight integration that has already been achieved. Building on this work, we outline a route towards uniting the different disciplines in a single framework, which may be used to better understand and, more importantly, to forecast climate change impacts on phenology. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Most studies of climate-driven changes in avian breeding phenology have focused on temperate passerines, yet the consequences of such environmental change may be more deleterious for other avian taxa, such as arctic and sub-arctic waders (Charadrii). We therefore examine large-scale climatic correlates of the breeding phenology of one such species (golden plover Pluvialis apricaria), and the timing of emergence of their adult tipulid prey, to assess the potential for climate change to disrupt breeding performance. Golden plover first-laying dates were negatively correlated with both March and April temperature, the mean laying date of first clutches was additionally negatively correlated with March rainfall. The timing of final laying dates were negatively correlated with April temperature only. The timing of tipulid emergence was negatively correlated with May temperature. In combination with historical climatic data, these models suggest a 9-day advancement of golden plover first-laying dates occurred during the 1990s, although this remains within the range of natural variation for the twentieth century. The magnitudes of predicted changes in mean and final laying dates, and the timing of tipulid emergence, were smaller. Climate predictions for 2070-2099 suggest potential advances in first-laying dates by 25 days, whilst the timings of mean and final laying dates are predicted to change by 18 days and 13 days, and tipulid emergence by 12 days. Given the importance of adult tipulids to young golden plover chicks, these changes may result in a mismatch between the timing of first-laying dates and tipulid emergence, so reducing the success of early breeding attempts. Modelling suggests that these changes could reduce breeding success in a South Pennines population by about 11\%. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

Population cycles most likely originate from trophic interactions within the plant- based tundra food web, where lemmings, either as prey for carnivores or as consumers of plants, play the key role. The predominance of trophic interaction cycles at northern latitudes is ultimately related to climate, and such cycles should therefore be vulnerable to climate change. Recent evidence indicates that changes have already taken place in the dynamics of some key herbivores and their predators, consistent with the expected impacts of climate change.

We evaluated common condition indices (Fulton's condition factor K-F, Le Cren's condition index K-{LC}, and two methods of estimating relative weight W.) against more direct measures of physiological condition (energy density, percent lipid content, and percent dry mass) and ecological condition (prey availability) for lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in Lake Huron. We developed four standard weight (W-s) equations using the regression length percentile ({RLP}) method: one for the species as a whole. and three separate equations describing immature, mature male, and mature female lake whitefish from 385 populations in North America. Species {RLP}-W-s showed less length-related bias and more closely matched empirical quartiles of lake-specific mean weight than did maturity- or sex-specific {RLP}-W-s equations. Significant length-related bias was detected in {EmP}-W-r. No biologically significant length-related bias was detected in K-{LC}, but this index was specific to a single population of fish. Species {RLP}-W-r showed no significant length-related bias, and K-F was significantly size dependent. All length-based condition indices were significantly correlated with energy density, percent lipid content, and percent dry mass. The index most strongly correlated with all three measures of physiological condition was K-F, likely because both the physiological measures and K-F exhibited positive relationships with body size. Across two Lake Huron sites, {RLP}-W-r was significantly correlated with density of prey (amphipods Diporeia spp.). Of the two condition indices developed in this study, {RLP}-W-r was consistently more strongly correlated with physiological condition indices than was {EmP}-W-r.},

	abstract = {Relative weight (Wr) is 100 x W/Ws, W being the weight of an individual fish and W the "standard" weight of a fish of the same length. The widespread application of relative weight in fisheries management has been hindered by the slow development of standard weights at length for many important fish species. We found the conventional approach to Ws development to be limited by data availability and improperly influenced by sample weighting. We designed and tested a method of Ws development that addresses these shortcomings. Our method treats log10weight-log10length regression equations for a series of a species' populations as the statistical population to be modeled. First, we predict mean fish weight in 1-cm total length intervals for each population. Then we find the 75th percentile of the mean weights in each interval, and regress these on length to determine the parameters for the Ws equation. Standard-weight equations determined by our regression-line-percentile ({RLP}) technique were functionally equivalent to published equations for several species tested. We then used the {RLP} technique to develop Ws equations for walleye Stizostedion vitreum based on 114 site-specific weight-length regressions for 42,487 fish from across North America. The metric equation is log10Ws (g) = -5.453 + 3.180 log10total length (mm). The English-unit equation is log10 Ws (lb) = -3.642 + 3.180 log10total length (in). There was no important influence of fish length on Wr values calculated with these equations. Neither proportional nor relative stock densities of walleyes were correlated meaningfully with Wr. Confidence interval width for mean Wr in walleye populations is directly predictable from sample size because sample variance is independent of sample size. "Desirable" mean Wr target values (100 ± 5) were achieved by approximately one quarter of the lakes in our sample. The {RLP} technique appears to be a viable approach to the development of Ws relationships that should speed and improve the application of Wr theory to important fish species.},

predators and prey are also needed for bioenergetics modeling, but direct measurements of {ED} are difficult to
obtain. Hence, investigators often borrow published values from the same species or related species. Alternatively,
models have been developed that predict {ED} from dry matter content ({DM}). The scarcity of published {ED} values
makes data borrowing and the generality of predictive modeling difficult to evaluate. We report new {ED} measurements
derived from bomb calorimetry for six freshwater fish species (Arctic Char Salvelinus alpinus, Brown Trout
Salmo trutta, kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka, Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush, Rainbow Trout O. mykiss, and White
Sucker Catostomus commersonii) and compared them to previously published data. We used our data to validate
existing {ED}:{DM} models and to fit new ones. We also quantified bias that could result from borrowing inappropriate
{ED} values for bioenergetics modeling. We collected a range of fish sizes from two reservoirs of differing productivity
and measured whole-body {ED} (wet-mass basis) and {DM}. Our data substantially increase the range of {ED} data
for Arctic Char, kokanee, and White Suckers. Two multispecies {ED}:{DM} models predicted the {ED} of our samples
accurately (mean root mean square error [{RMSE}] {\textless} 500 J/g), even at the extremes for the range of prediction

	abstract = {Rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, were fed pelleted food ad libitum for 35 and 50 days. Lipid deposits were determined in the viscera, liver and muscle (epaxial and hypaxial). Most of the lipid accumulated in the viscera, but the lipid content of liver and epaxial muscle also increased. Hypaxial muscle lipid content remained the same throughout the feeding period. Upon starving the fish for 27 and 48 days following 50 days of feeding, visceral lipid contributed most to energy metabolism among the depots investigated. Muscle also contributed a considerable share while the absolute amount derived from the liver was much smaller. Patterns of fatty acid mobilization during starvation were also investigated. Saturated acids were preferentially mobilized from the viscera, resulting in a rise in the percentage of monoenes and polyunsaturates. In liver, the percentage of saturates remained relatively constant whereas the percentage of monoenes declined and polyunsaturates increased. In muscle, a substantial increase in saturates was caused by a decline in monoenes; polyunsaturate content remained constant. As a result of these shifts in relative fatty acid composition the U/S (unsaturates to saturates) ratio rose in viscera and liver and decreased in muscle. The {UI} (unsaturation index) responded in essentially the same way. Possible explanations for preferential fatty acid utilization are discussed in terms of energetics and structural relationships.

By reviewing the literature on this subject, we found that the effectiveness (ability to remove all stomach contents) of the different methods depends on size, age, species of fish, and the size of the food items in the stomach. Overall, various methods of stomach flushing were the most effective method of recovering stomach items from a variety of fishes. Mechanized pressure appeared to be the most efficient method of stomach flushing for most large fishes. The use of syringes allowed stomach flushing to be performed on most young and small fishes. The use of tubes and stomach suctions, much simpler and less expensive methods than stomach flushing, were nearly as effective for some fishes such as black bass (Micropterus spp.) and salmonids.},

The aim of this paper is to discuss and suggest solutions to the multifaceted problems associated with studying behavioural variation in salmonids, with focus on designing behavioural studies that are ecologically relevant. Many of the general problems and solutions discussed can be applied to other animals as well. First, the importance of asking clear questions when conceiving behavioural studies is addressed, using Tinbergen’s four questions and associated theories as stepping stones towards generating testable hypotheses about behavioural variation. We then address a range of methodological challenges encountered when attempting to study behavioural variation in salmonids and suggest solutions to overcome these problems. A range of approaches is discussed, from highly controllable laboratory experiments to monitoring studies of behaviour in the wild. The importance of combining lab- and field approaches to evaluate the ecological relevance of behavioural variation is highlighted. Finally, we suggest a general framework using a multi-faceted research approach to address questions about the behavioural ecology of salmonids (and other animals) so that knowledge can progress, and the ecological relevance of behavioural studies can be validated.},

	volume = {12},
	doi = {10.1034/j.1600-0633.2003.00010.x},
	abstract = {Among the species in the family Salmonidae, those represented by the genera Salmo, Salvelinus, and Oncorhynchus (subfamily Salmoninae) are the most studied. Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3-5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackfish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent {mtDNA} studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.},

	abstract = {Daily movements of mobile organisms between habitats in response to changing trade-offs between predation risk and foraging gains are well established; however, less in known about whether similar tactics are used during reproduction, a time period when many organisms are particularly vulnerable to predators. We investigated the reproductive behaviour of adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and the activity of their principal predator, brown bears (Ursus arctos), on streams in south-western Alaska. Specifically, we continuously monitored movements of salmon between lake habitat, where salmon are invulnerable to bears, and three small streams, where salmon spawn and are highly vulnerable to bears. We conducted our study across 2 years that offered a distinct contrast in bear activity and predation rates. Diel movements by adult sockeye salmon between stream and lake habitat were observed in 51·3\% ± 17·7\% (mean ± {SD}) of individuals among years and sites. Fish that moved tended to hold in the lake for most of the day and then migrated into spawning streams during the night, coincident with when bear activity on streams tended to be lowest. Additionally, cyclic movements between lakes and spawning streams were concentrated earlier in the spawning season. Individuals that exhibited diel movements had longer average reproductive life spans than those who made only one directed movement into a stream. However, the relative effect was dependent on the timing of bear predation, which varied between years. When predation pressure primarily occurred early in the spawning run (i.e., during the height of the diel movements), movers lived 120-310\% longer than non-movers. If predation pressure was concentrated later in the spawning run (i.e. when most movements had ceased), movers only lived 10-60\% longer. Our results suggest a dynamic trade-off in reproductive strategies of sockeye salmon; adults must be in the stream to reproduce, but must also avoid predation long enough to spawn. Given the interannual variation in the timing and intensity of predation pressure, the advantages of a particular movement strategy will likely vary among years. Regardless, movements by salmon allowed individuals to exploit fine-scale habitat heterogeneity during reproduction, which appears to be a strategy to reduce predation risk on the spawning grounds.},

Although this view may be correct in terms of bulk budgets and fluxes, it neglects the potential of animals to focus contaminants into foodwebs due to their behaviors and lifecycles. In particular, gregarious animals that biomagnify and bioaccumulate certain contaminants and then migrate and congregate can become the predominant pathway for contaminants in many circumstances. Fish and birds provide prominent examples for such behavior. This review examines the potential for biovector transport to expose populations to contaminants. In addition, we apply a modeling approach to compare the potential of biovector transport to other physical transport pathways for a hypothetical lake receiving large numbers of fish. We conclude that biovector transport should not be neglected when considering environmental risks of biomagnifying contaminants. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Most empirical and theoretical studies of resource use and population dynamics treat conspecific individuals as ecologically equivalent. This simplification is only justified if interindividual niche variation is rare, weak, or has a trivial effect on ecological processes. This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simplifications. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.},

	doi = {10.1139/cjfas-2013-0175},
	abstract = {Starvation periods are common for many animals, including fish, birds, and mammals. Many fish species exhibit extraordinary resilience to prolonged starvation, but the reasons for that and the mechanisms employed during these periods are poorly understood. This study shows that similar to mammals and birds, many fish species undergo three phases during starvation: (I) a short transient phase, ({II}) a long, protein conservation steady state phase with mainly fat oxidation as the primary energy source, and ({III}) a shift to protein mobilization as a main energy source. These starvation states and their transitions were quantified by a meta-analysis of large empirical data available in the literature, revealing that low critical levels of fat reserves trigger the transition to the third state. The critical fat level, denoted as γ (percentage of total lipid in body mass), ranges between 0.7\% and 5\%, depending on the species. It appears that these transitions in the energy mobilization phases are regulated by hormonal changes, including growth hormone ({GH}), leptin, cortisol, and ghrelin, but the exact mechanisms are still unclear and should be further investigated. Simulations in silico of starvation periods at various temperatures using a dynamic model indicated that temperature affects the length of Phase {II} because of changes in protein metabolism, with consequences on the ability to withstand prolonged starvation.},

Age-0 trout subjected to simulated winter starvation conditions gradually depleted lipid reserves to a critical minimum lipid content below which death occurred. Small fish with lower lipid content exhausted lipid reserves earlier, and experienced high mortality rates sooner, than larger fish with greater lipid content. Consequently, winter starvation endurance was dependent upon size-dependent lipid reserves and winter duration. To validate the laboratory findings in the field, we stocked several size classes of hatchery-raised trout with known lipid content at the start of winter into two experimental lakes, and estimated survival and lipid depletion at winter's end. Larger age-0 trout had greater initial lipid reserves than smaller trout. Individuals depleted most of their lipid reserves over the winter, and experienced mortality that ranged from just under 60\% for the largest individuals to just over 90\% of the smallest individuals. Many survivors had lipid contents near, but none were below, the minimum lipid content determined in the laboratory.},

Using a 10-year dataset from the boreal Batchawana River in Northern Ontario, we found that fish feeding niche was temporally invariant in the lower sampled river reaches but increased over time in the upper reaches of the river. A significant relationship between the standard deviations of mean δ15N and mean daily summer flow was found. No other significant relationships between measures of flow or temperature variability and variability in δ13C or δ15N were observed. Fish feeding niche was significantly larger in the lower than in the upper Batchawana River, but there were no significant differences in mean fish community δ13C or δ15N between reaches. Fish assemblage δ13C, δ15N and standard ellipse area were consistent among years within river reaches despite flow and temperature variability over the same years.

	doi = {10.1577/t08-113.1},
	abstract = {—In size-structured populations, predator–prey interactions may be preceded by a phase of resource competition earlier in ontogeny, with potential consequences for population dynamics and resource management. We hypothesized that brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and yellow perch Perca flavescens would compete for shared resources and interact as predator and prey. We used stable isotopes and stomach content analysis to compare the trophic ecology of brook trout in lakes with and without yellow perch. Percent littoral resource use by brook trout differed between perch and nonperch systems, ranging from approximately 50\% to 100\% in nonperch lakes compared with 10–70\% in perch lakes. Nonpiscivorous-sized brook trout (fork length [{FL}] , 25 cm) showed a significant ontogenetic diet shift toward greater pelagic resource use during growth from 15 to 25 cm in sympatry with yellow perch. Nonpiscivorous-sized brook trout in nonperch lakes consumed a mixture of zoobenthos, zooplankton, and littoral prey fish. In contrast, in lakes containing yellow perch, nonpiscivorous-sized brook trout fed primarily on pelagic prey. Brook trout shifted to piscivory at a {FL} of approximately 25 cm in both perch and nonperch systems. Isotopic results and stomach content analysis indicated that yellow perch were the primary prey of piscivorous-sized brook trout ({FL} . 25 cm) in perch lakes, occurring in 66–100\% of the brook trout sampled and accounting for over 97\% of the diet by weight. Overall, the presence of yellow perch resulted in a shift in the energetic basis for brook trout production from primarily littoral to primarily pelagic. The shift in brook trout food web position was associated with a decline in brook trout catch per unit effort. We conclude that brook trout and yellow perch interact as intraguild predator and prey and that the interaction is dominated by yellow perch. In size-structured populations, predator–prey inter-actions may be preceded by a phase of resource competition earlier in ontogeny. Such mixed interac-tions are referred to as intraguild predation (Polis et al. 1989). The combination of predation and competition that characterizes intraguild predation leads to unique population dynamics not observed in simple unstruc-tured interactions (Polis and Holt 1992; De Roos and Persson 2005). In particular, prey may have both a negative and a positive effect on their predator depending on whether the interaction is dominated by competition or predation (Olson et al. 1995). This scenario may lead to unique outcomes such as the imposition of a recruitment bottleneck on the predator population by prey species and the possible occurrence of alternative states of either predator or prey dominance due to priority effects (Persson et al. 2007). Fish populations are size-structured and many species undergo ontogenetic niche shifts during growth from larval to adult stages (Werner and Gilliam 1984). The fact that piscivores typically pass through a succession of diet shifts from small to large prey suggests intraguild predation may be a common interaction among fish species (Polis and Holt 1992). With recent interest in ecosystem-based management of fisheries, the effect of fish community interactions on the population dynamics of exploited fish popula-tions has received particular attention (Evans et al. 1987; Mangel and Levin 2005). Within the suite of community interactions, mixed competition–predation interactions are hypothesized to lead to alternative states in commercial and sport fisheries for top predators due to the potential for prey fish to impose a juvenile recruitment bottleneck on the predator (Walters and Kitchell 2001; Post et al. 2002). Despite extensive theoretical examination of what such mixed interactions may mean for fish population dynamics, few examples of intraguild predation among fish},

The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health of aquatic ecosystems, including water quality issues and the distribution of aquatic species within the river environment. Consequently, for conducting environmental impact assessments as well as for effective fisheries management, it is important to understand the thermal behaviour of rivers and related heat exchange processes. 2. This study reviews the different river thermal processes responsible for water temperature variability on both the temporal (e.g. diel, daily, seasonal) and spatial scales, as well as providing information related to different water temperature models currently found in the literature. 3. Water temperature models are generally classified into three groups: regression, stochastic and deterministic models. Deterministic models employ an energy budget approach to predict river water temperature, whereas regression and stochastic models generally rely on air to water temperature relationships. 4. Water temperature variability can occur naturally or as a result of anthropogenic perturbations, such as thermal pollution, deforestation, flow modification and climate change. Literature information is provided on the thermal regime of rivers in relation to anthropogenic impacts and such information will contribute to the better protection of fish habitat and more efficient fisheries management. © 2006 The Author.},

Moreover, species differences were most pronounced when overall growth was high during the spring and early summer. These growth differences resulted in size asymmetries that were sustained over the duration of the study. A literature survey also indicated that non-native salmonids typically grow faster than native salmonids when the two occur in sympatry.

Both species were collected during July‐October 1987 from the Columbia River, U.S.A. Relationships between fish weight (= volume) and maximum volume of the digestive organ were best fitted for coho salmon by an allometric model and for northern squawfish by an exponential model. Least squares regression analysis of individual measurements showed less variability in the volume of coho salmon stomachs (R2= 0.85) than in the total digestive tracts (R2= 0.55) and foreguts (R2= 0.61) of northern squawfish, relative to fish size. Compared to previous methods, the new technique has the advantage of accurately measuring the internal volume of a wide range of digestive organ shapes and sizes. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

	abstract = {Synchrony between reproduction and food availability is important in mammals due to the high energetic costs of gestation and lactation. Female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) must accumulate sufficient energy reserves during spring through autumn to produce and nurse cubs during the winter months in snow dens. Adequate time in a den is important to optimize cub development for withstanding harsh Arctic spring conditions and to synchronize emergence with peak prey availability, which occurs in May and June. During 1985-2013, den phenology was investigated using temperature data collected on satellite collars deployed on adult female polar bears in the southern Beaufort Sea ({SB}) and Chukchi Sea ({CS}). We examined relationships between den phenology, reproductive success (cub production and post-emergence survival), and environmental factors (weather and sea-ice conditions). Females observed with cubs emerged later and remained in dens on average 15.0 ± 7.6 ({SE}) days longer than females seen without cubs. Females occupying land-based dens, where estimated snowfall was greater, had higher reproductive success. Recently, female polar bears have increased land-based denning in the {SB}. Females in {CS} emerged later from dens than {SB} females, consistent with better female body condition and higher cub survival in the {CS}. During years with a greater area of autumn sea ice, reproductive success was higher at land-based versus sea-ice dens, suggesting continued decline in sea ice could negatively affect recruitment. However, further research is needed to better understand mechanistic relationships. Because females emerging later from dens had higher reproductive success, den duration could be a useful metric in population monitoring.},

	abstract = {Large digestive organs increase rates of energy gain when food is plentiful but are costly to maintain and increase rates of energy loss when food is scarce. The physiological adaptations to this trade-off differ depending on the scale and predictability of variation in food abundance. Currently, there is little understanding of how animals balance trade-offs between the cost and capacity of the digestive system in response to resource pulses: rare, ephemeral periods of resource superabundance. We investigated the physiological and behavioural tactics of the fish Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) that rear in watersheds with low in situ productivity, but experience annual resource pulses from the spawning migrations of Pacific salmon. The eggs of Pacific salmon provide high-energy food for Dolly Varden. Dolly Varden sampled 6 weeks prior to the resource pulse exhibited atrophy of the stomach, pyloric caeca, intestine and liver. Throughout the portion of the growing season prior to the resource pulse, fish exhibited empty stomachs, low indices of energy condition and muscle isotope signatures reflecting the previous resource pulse. During the resource pulse, Dolly Varden exhibited large digestive machinery, gorged on salmon eggs and rapidly stored energy in fat reserves, somatic growth and gonad development. Dolly Varden appeared to achieve nearly their entire annual energy surplus during the {\textasciitilde}5-week period when sockeye salmon spawn. Digestive flexibility provides Dolly Varden the energy efficiency required to survive and reproduce when resource abundance is concentrated into an annual pulse that is predictable, yet highly ephemeral. Although fish are known to incur extremely variable energy budgets, our study is one of the first to document digestive flexibility in wild fish. Our study emphasizes that fish can rely heavily on rare, high-magnitude foraging opportunities. Human actions that attenuate spikes in food abundance may have stronger than anticipated effects on consumer energy budgets. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

	doi = {10.2527/1996.74102541x},
	abstract = {In digesting and absorbing dietary nutrients, the gastrointestinal tract consumes approximately 20\% of all incoming energy. A substantial proportion of this consumption is due to the rapid turnover of cellular protein, which permits abrupt changes in gut size to occur, matching capacity with delivery. If it is size of the alimentary tract that constrains nutrient uptake, greater than 20\% allocation of {ME} intake above maintenance to the gut would improve the growth rate of a young animal but the efficiency of {ME} utilization for growth would deteriorate. Less than 15\% allocation in birds seems injurious to both growth rate and efficiency of growth. Nutrient transport capacity of the intestine may be modulated independent of size; in the case of glucose, an up- or down-regulation of the number of brush-border glucose transporters matches absorptive capacity with delivery. The maximum uptake capacity of a small intestine for glucose at any moment in time is a function of its length, the flow rate of digesta, and the distributed-in-space kinetic parameters of transport (e.g., Vmax and Km). An example maximum uptake capacity for glucose in sheep is calculated at 2,112 g/d, assuming continuous digesta flow. Intermittency of flow reduces the uptake capacity to a functional level of 295 g/d, demonstrating a constraining influence of the periodicity of the migrating myoelectric complex. Growth regulation by stimulatory and inhibitory mitotic signals is presented as a candidate for an energy-independent determinant of the upper limit to functional maximum uptake capacity of the small intestine. Both size and functional capacity of the intestine must be considered in assessing the impact this tissue may have on the rest of the animal.},

	abstract = {A central challenge for predators is achieving positive energy balance when prey are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. Ecological heterogeneity produces evolutionary trade-offs in the physiological design of predators; this is because the ability to capitalize on pulses of food abundance requires high capacity for food-processing, yet maintaining such capacity imposes energetic costs that are taxing during periods of food scarcity. Recent advances in physiology show that when variation in foraging opportunities is predictable, animals may adjust energetic trade-offs by rapidly modulating their digestive system to track variation in foraging opportunities. However, it is increasingly recognized that foraging opportunities for animals are unpredictable, which should favour animals that maintain a capacity for food-processing that exceeds average levels of consumption (loads). Despite this basic principle of quantitative evolutionary design, estimates of digestive load:capacity ratios in wild animals are virtually non-existent. Here we provide an extensive assessment of load:capacity ratios for the digestive systems of predators in the wild, compiling 639 estimates across 38 species of fish. We found that piscine predators typically maintain the physiological capacity to feed at daily rates 2-3 times higher than what they experience on average. A numerical simulation of the trade-off between food-processing capacity and metabolic cost suggests that the observed level of physiological opportunism is profitable only if predator-prey encounters, and thus predator energy budgets, are far more variable in nature than currently assumed. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

protein was significantly lower for fish fed once a day compared with treatments of two or four times a day. Muscle
cholesterol tended to increase with increasing feeding frequencies, but the results were not significant. No significant
treatment effect was detected on the plasma mineral content. Based on a feeding rate of 5\% body weight/d,
it is recommended that feedings are divided into three meals a day to increase available energy for optimal growth.},

In contrast, there is a paucity of knowledge on how the interaction of energy supply and social status determines patterns of residency and movement. This study tests whether the presence of conspecifics and an individual’s social status in relation to food supply influence the fitness and movement of a drift-feeding fish (Galaxias fasciatus). Using an information-theoretic approach ({AIC}), our analysis indicated that the most parsimonious model of fish movement among pools was one that included food supply, social rank and fish relative growth rate. Our results indicated that subordinate fish relocated more frequently compared to dominant fish, most likely as a consequence of intra-specific competition that limited the access of these smaller fish to resources and constrained their growth. Our results suggest that energy constraints may force individuals to explore new habitats in an effort to find more energetically profitable patches. We conclude that intra-specific competition mediated through the social hierarchy amongst closely interacting individuals plays a key role in determining individual growth, residency and relocation.},

	abstract = {Time can be a limiting constraint for consumers, particularly when resource phenology mediates foraging opportunity. Though a large body of research has explored how resource phenology influences trophic interactions, this work has focused on the topics of trophic mismatch or predator swamping, which typically occur over short periods, at small spatial extents or coarse resolutions. In contrast many consumers integrate across landscape heterogeneity in resource phenology, moving to track ephemeral food sources that propagate across space as resource waves. Here we provide a conceptual framework to advance the study of phenological diversity and resource waves. We define resource waves, review evidence of their importance in recent case studies, and demonstrate their broader ecological significance with a simulation model. We found that consumers ranging from fig wasps (Chalcidoidea) to grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) exploit resource waves, inte- grating across phenological diversity to make resource aggregates available for much longer than their component parts. In model simulations, phenological diversity was often more important to consumer energy gain than resource abundance per se. Current ecosystem- based management assumes that species abundance mediates the strength of trophic interactions. Our results challenge this assumption and highlight new opportunities for conservation and management. Resource waves are an emergent property of consumer– resource interactions and are broadly significant in ecology and conservation.},

	abstract = {Seasonal variation in river water levels creates a shifting mosaic of habitat conditions associated with variables such as water temperature, chemistry and prey availability to consumers. Previous work has shown that fishes can exploit spatial variation in water temperature, but less is known about how they respond to shifts in the spatial arrangement of habitat conditions through time. Juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) are the numerically dominant fish species in many southwest Alaskan streams, which exhibit seasonal variation in water level and temperature due to changes in precipitation and snowmelt. We assessed the degree to which juvenile coho salmon exploit the associated shifting mosaic of water temperature by monitoring the spatial distribution of water temperatures and juvenile coho salmon in the lake-influenced reaches of a southwest Alaskan stream. We also monitored the diets of juvenile coho salmon relative to the spatial distribution of prey taxa. Juvenile coho salmon exhibited two scales of movement to track spatiotemporal variation in habitat conditions. First, over the course of 6 weeks, individuals moved among off-channel units, tracking shifts in the location of warm water habitat caused by receding water level. Second, individuals moved at diel time scales, foraging on benthic macroinvertebrates in the cold thalweg of the stream at night and then digesting prey in warmer off-channel habitats during the day. Seasonally asynchronous variation in water temperature among off-channel habitat units produced portfolio effects in habitat conditions, such that coho salmon had continual access to warm habitat for digestion despite its ephemeral availability at discrete locations. Our study demonstrates that behavioural thermoregulation by juvenile fishes can be important throughout the growing season and is not restricted to ephemeral events such as resource pulses or heat stress. Our results have implications for the conservation of highly connected, heterogeneous landscapes, and their ability to support economically and ecologically important species such as coho salmon.},

Metabolic models of energy expenditure were derived from literature sources, but measurements of energy availability were site-specific. From the energy models, we assigned a suitability value of 1.0 to the entire range of velocities where positive net energy gains were predicted, and a suitability value of zero to velocities where negative net energy gains were predicted. Predicted net energy gain velocities were compared with observed velocities used by each species. For rainbow trout, the energetic model predicted energetically profitable velocities ranging from 5 to 45 cm s-1. Predicted velocities were similar to velocities used by rainbow trout. This indicated that rainbow trout, as a group, were using energetically profitable stream locations, but some rainbow trout used non-profitable velocities. For Colorado River cutthroat trout, the energetic model predicted energetically profitable velocities ranging from 5 to 45 cm s-1; however, Colorado River cutthroat trout used significantly lower velocities than predicted. The dissimilarity between velocities predicted and used by Colorado River cutthroat trout may be attributed to their inability to utilize energetically profitable velocities available in the stream because of depth restrictions. The results suggest that the predictive abilities of energetic models vary between streams because of differences in depth and velocity availability. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic flexibility in physiological, morphological and behavioural traits can allow organisms to cope with environmental challenges. Given recent climate change and the degree of habitat modification currently experienced by many organisms, it is therefore critical to quantify the degree of phenotypic variation present within populations, individual capacities to change and what their consequences are for fitness. Flexibility in standard metabolic rate ({SMR}) may be particularly important since {SMR} reflects the minimal energetic cost of living and is one of the primary traits underlying organismal performance. {SMR} can increase or decrease in response to food availability, but the consequences of these changes for growth rates and other fitness components are not well known. We examined individual variation in metabolic flexibility in response to changing food levels and its consequences for somatic growth in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). {SMR} increased when individuals were switched to a high food ration and decreased when they were switched to a low food regime. These shifts in {SMR}, in turn, were linked with individual differences in somatic growth; those individuals that increased their {SMR} more in response to elevated food levels grew fastest, while growth at the low food level was fastest in those individuals that depressed their {SMR} most. Flexibility in energy metabolism is therefore a key mechanism to maximize growth rates under the challenges imposed by variability in food availability and is likely to be an important determinant of species' resilience in the face of global change.},

While including the same capabilities as previous versions, Fish Bioenergetics 4.0 allows for timely updates and bug fixes and can be continuously improved based on feedback from users. In addition, users can add new or modified parameter sets for additional species and formulate and incorporate modifications such as habitat-dependent functions (e.g., dissolved oxygen, salinity) that are not part of the default package. We hope that advances in the new modeling platform will attract a broad range of users while facilitating continued application of bioenergetics modeling to a wide spectrum of questions in fish biology, ecology, and management.},

After 4 and 12 days of ice-storage, lactate and glycogen levels decreased and {pH} increased in white muscle with increasing starvation time. The K-value, determined after 4 and 12 days of ice-storage, decreased as the duration of starvation increased. Trimethylamine was not detected in white muscle. Sensory analyses showed that cooked fillets from groups starved for 86 days had less fresh flavour than that of groups starved for 30 days or less. The fillets of groups starved for 30 days had significantly higher acidulous flavour compared with that of groups starved for 0-14 days, whereas groups starved for 58 or 86 days had significantly less acidulous flavour than all other groups. The sensory assessed hardness of cooked fillets was significantly lower in groups starved for 86 days vs. those starved for 0, 14 or 30 days. In contrast, instrumental texture analyses of raw fillets, after 4 days of ice-storage, showed that the force against compression (at 5 mm) was higher in groups starved for 58 or 86 days than in those starved for a shorter time. Although astaxanthin concentration was not significantly affected by starvation time, instrumental colour analyses ({CIE} 1976) of raw fillets revealed changes in lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*). Although starvation produces some changes in white muscle composition, the rather marginal differences in freshness, texture and colour characteristics of raw or cooked fillets when starvation time varied from 0 to 86 days, suggest that starvation is a rather weak tool for changing fillet quality in Atlantic salmon.},

One shallow-water zoarcid, Eucryphycus californicus, and an ecologically and morphologically similar stichaeid fish Xiphister atropurpureus were collected from intertidal and subtidal habitats in Monterey Bay. We investigated the absorption and assimilation efficiencies of these fishes to determine whether deep-sea species have evolved mechanisms to increase their efficiency of food use. Fishes were placed in experimental chambers and fed a known quantity of food. Ammonia excretion was measured and feces were collected daily. Both food and feces were analyzed for water, protein, lipid and ash to determine specific absorption efficiencies. Absorption ranged from 87.7 to 92.4\% and assimilation efficiencies from 84.0 to 86.5\%. Meal sizes from 0.5 to 4.0\% of body weight did not affect the results. No significant differences were found between deep-sea and shallow-water species fed single meals or fed ad libitum for 10 days. This suggests that the selective pressure to maximize absorption and assimilation is universal and is not affected by the productivity of the habitat occupied. However, the relative size of the intestine in the deep-sea species was significantly smaller suggesting that they had a lower metabolic cost to maintain their digestive apparatus. It could not be concluded whether this was the result of pressure to conserve energy or rather the tendency of the shallow-living species to ingest more refractory material (i.e. sediment, algae). © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

In contrast, the limpet Nacella concinna (Strebel, 1908) feeds throughout the year. To compare the differing physiological responses demonstrated by a continually feeding species and species that cease feeding during winter we measured seasonal changes in N. concinna faecal egestion, oxygen consumption, O:N ratios, ammonia, urea and primary amine excretion at 4 points in the year. Tissue ash-free dry mass decreased by 47\% and faecal egestion 10-fold from summer to winter. Metabolic rates decreased significantly in winter (December, 0.61 ± 0.04 μmol O2h-1; October, 0.38 ± 0.04 μmol O2 h-1), but to a much lesser degree than other Antarctic marine invertebrates. Ammonia and urea excretion rates showed significant seasonal variations, while no clear pattern was evident in primary amine excretion. Ammonia excretion decreased during late summer and early winter before increasing in spring (minimum, February, 66.23 ± 5.72 nmol h-1; maximum, December, 170.83 ± 9.50 nmol h-1). Urea excretion was low in summer (December, 9.88 ± 1.60 nmol h-1) and maximal (July, 26.70 ± 4.05 nmol h-1) in winter. Urea and primary amine excretion combined accounted for between 10 and 38\% of total nitrogen excretion. O:N ratios ranged between 7 and 20 and demonstrated that although protein was the dominant respiratory substrate throughout the year, in late summer and early winter lipids and carbohydrates were also utilised for metabolism. N. concinna has a low degree of metabolic seasonality due to the maintenance of high winter metabolic rates. Although feeding during winter provides some energy, it is insufficient to offset the substantial utilisation of tissue energy stores to balance the metabolic budget.},

	abstract = {A series of laboratory-based equations on trout growth and bioenergetics developed by J.M. Elliott were applied to data collected for brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) under field conditions in Co. Mayo, Western Ireland. Fish were collected by electrofishing eight upland streams with contrasting riparian vegetation; grassland, open canopy and closed canopy deciduous. Stream temperatures, one of the main influencing factors on fish growth and energetics, did not differ significantly between riparian types. Observed growth rates were lower than the predicted maximum growth rates and were not influenced by riparian vegetation type. Growth ranged between 0.66\% day-1 for 0 + trout to 0.08\% day-1 for 2 + trout. Production estimates showed no clear difference between riparian vegetation types over the growing season. Fish densities and biomass tended to be greater in closed canopy streams particularly in summer. Actual ration sizes calculated for trout were similar to the ration required for maintenance metabolism and were only 45-63\% of the maximum potential rations. Although there was an ontogenetic increase in ration size with increasing fish age, the proportion of ration available for growth (i.e. the difference between actual and maintenance rations) did not differ between age classes but was greatest in summer. 1+ and 2+ trout show greatest ration available for growth in grassland streams. Trout growth did not differ between riparian vegetation types but did vary seasonally with greatest attainment in summer. Growth was limited in the present study possibly due to combined effects of reduced prey available to fish and low stream temperatures reducing metabolic requirements. In such food limited systems, terrestrial invertebrate energy subsidies could have significant benefits to brown trout growth, production and bioenergetics. © 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Our review and meta-analysis on salmonid fishes estimates the frequency of {LA} to be ∼55-70\%, with local populations having a 1.2 times average fitness advantage relative to foreign populations or to their performance in new environments. Salmonid {LA} is evident at a variety of spatial scales (for example, few km to gt; 1000 km) and can manifest itself quickly (6-30 generations). As the geographic scale between populations increases, {LA} is generally more frequent and stronger. Yet the extent of {LA} in salmonids does not appear to differ from that in other assessed taxa. Moreover, the frequency with which foreign salmonid populations outperform local populations (∼23-35\%) suggests that drift, gene flow and plasticity often limit or mediate {LA}. The relatively few studies based on candidate gene and genomewide analyses have identified footprints of selection at both small and large geographical scales, likely reflecting the specific functional properties of loci and the associated selection regimes (for example, local niche partitioning, pathogens, parasites, photoperiodicity and seasonal timing). The molecular basis of {LA} in salmonids is still largely unknown, but differential expression at the same few genes is implicated in the convergent evolution of certain phenotypes. Collectively, future research will benefit from an integration of classical and molecular approaches to understand: (i) species differences and how they originate, (ii) variation in adaptation across scales, life stages, population sizes and environmental gradients, and (iii) evolutionary responses to human activities. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

In vertebrates, the molecular pathway that leads to this asymmetry uses the signalling molecule Nodal, a member of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, which is expressed in the left lateral plate mesoderm, and loss of nodal function produces a randomization of the left-right asymmetry of visceral organs. Orthologues of nodal have also been described in other deuterostomes, including ascidians and sea urchins, but no nodal orthologue has been reported in the other two main clades of Bilateria: Ecdysozoa (including flies and nematodes) and Lophotrochozoa (including snails and annelids). Here we report the first evidence for a nodal orthologue in a non-deuterostome group. We isolated nodal and Pitx (one of the targets of Nodal signalling) in two species of snails and found that the side of the embryo that expresses nodal and Pitx is related to body chirality: both genes are expressed on the right side of the embryo in the dextral (right-handed) species Lottia gigantea and on the left side in the sinistral (left-handed) species Biomphalaria glabrata. We pharmacologically inhibited the Nodal pathway and found that nodal acts upstream of Pitx, and that some treated animals developed with a loss of shell chirality. These results indicate that the involvement of the Nodal pathway in left-right asymmetry might have been an ancestral feature of the Bilateria.},

Biomasses of breeders, non-breeders and chicks present vicinity of the colony, are coupled with an ambient temperature function, the bioenergetic equations of Kendeigh, and calculations of the energy costs of digestion, activity, production and growth. (3) The model is tested using input data sets for great skua Catharacta skua and Arctic tern Sterna paradisaea Pontopp. Sensitivity of the model to errors parameters, and the output errors resulting from known imprecisions in the input parameters are examined. Output precision is largely determined parameters, which depend partly on the life-style energy allocation of the species. (4) A Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the precision of the estimated requirements of the two species' populations. This suggests that, using currently input data, the population energy requirement estimate has a 95\% confidence interval + 50o of the mean. (5) Energy requirements could be considerably more precisely determined if only a small number of input parameters were more precisely known. These limiting parameters are listed. (6) The model is applied to one particular seabird community, on Foula, Shetland, for which detailed data have been collected. The mean estimate of the total energy requirement of this community (1 2 x 101 0 kcal yr - 1) represents 29\% of the mean estimate of the total annual fish production within a 45 km radius of the colony. This implies that seabirds, predatory demersal fish and industrial fisheries are in direct competition for the energy flow from pelagic fish, such that any increase in the energy flow to one of these would result in a reduced energy availability to the others.},

	abstract = {1. Pacific salmon are thought to stimulate the productivity of the fresh waters in which they spawn by fertilising them with marine-derived nutrients ({MDN}). We compared the influence of salmon spawners on surface streamwater chemistry and benthic biota among three southeastern Alaska streams. Within each stream, reaches up- and downstream of barriers to salmon migration were sampled during or soon after spawners entered the streams. 2. Within streams, concentrations of dissolved ammonium and soluble reactive phosphorus ({SRP}), abundance of epilithon (chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass) and biomass of chironomids were significantly higher in reaches with salmon spawners. In contrast, biomass of the mayflies Epeorus spp. and Rhithrogena spp. was significantly higher in reaches lacking spawners. 3. Among streams, significant differences were found in concentrations of dissolved ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate and {SRP}, abundance of epilithon, and the biomass of chironomids and Rhithrogena. These differences did not appear to reflect differences among streams in spawner density, nor the changes in water chemistry resulting from salmon spawners. 4. Our results suggest that the 'enrichment' effect of salmon spawners (e.g. increased streamwater nutrient concentrations) was balanced by other concurrent effects of spawners on streams (e.g. sediment disturbance). Furthermore, the collective effect of spawners on lotic ecosystems is likely to be constrained by conditions unique to individual streams, such as temperature, background water chemistry and light attenuation.},

Biofilm, aquatic macroinvertebrates (detritivores, shredders, and predators), and fish (coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, and cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki) were sampled from streams in which Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses had been artificially placed or were present naturally. In the presence of carcasses, all trophic levels incorporated marine-derived nitrogen (range, 22-73\% of total N) and carbon (range, 7-52\% of total C). In general, chironomid midges assimilated more marine-derived nitrogen and carbon than did other consumers. The assimilation of {MDN} by aquatic organisms and subsequent isotopic enrichment (5-6??? for 15N, 3-4??? for 13C) were similar in experimentally and naturally carcass-enriched streams. For specific taxa, however, percent assimilation for marine nitrogen and carbon were often dissimilar, possibly because of fractionation or transfer inefficiencies. These results suggest that pathways of {MDN} incorporation into stream food webs include both consumption of salmon material by macroinvertebrates and fish and uptake of mineralized {MDN} by biofilm. Incorporation of {MDN} into multiple trophic levels demonstrates the ecological significance of annual returns of anadromous fishes for sustaining the productivity of freshwater food webs.},

When a single experimental lake was examined, we could not detect effects of phosphorus (P) input rate, dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}), and grazing on chlorophyll. When three experimental lakes with contrasting {DOC} and food webs were subjected to the same schedule of P input manipulations, all three impacts and their interactions were measurable. Focus on multiple alternatives has important implications for design of ecosystem experiments.

Implications for persistent organic pollutant ({POP}) concentrations and patterns measured in the two feeding groups of grizzly bears were profound. While the bears consuming a higher proportion of terrestrial vegetation ("interior" grizzlies) exhibited {POP} patterns dominated by the more volatile organochlorine ({OC}) pesticides and the heavier polybrominated diphenyl ethers ({PBDEs}: e.g., {BDE}-209), the bears consuming salmon were dominated by the more bioaccumulative {POPs} (e.g., {DDT}, chlordanes, and {BDE}-47). The ocean-salmon-bear pathway appeared to preferentially select for those contaminants with intermediate partitioning strength from water into lipid (log K0w ∼ 6.5). This pattern reflects an optimum contaminant log K0w range for atmospheric transport, deposition into the marine environment, uptake into marine biota, accumulation through the food web, and retention in the bear tissues. We estimate that salmon deliver 70\% of all {OC} pesticides, up to 85\% of the lower brominated {PBDE} congeners, and 90\% of {PCBs} found in salmon-eating grizzly bears, thereby inextricably linking these terrestrial predators to contaminants from the North Pacific Ocean. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) deliver salmon-derived nutrients ({SDN}) to the streams in which they spawn. However, many stream parameters, such as discharge and spawner abundance, can vary from year to year, which could alter the quantity and flux of {SDN}. Over six consecutive years, we studied responses in streamwater chemistry and epilithon (i.e. the microbial community on submerged rocks) to salmon spawners in Fish Creek, southeastern Alaska, U.S.A. The lower reach of Fish Creek receives spawners of several salmon species, while the upper reach does not receive spawners because of an intervening waterfall. We estimated salmon spawner biomass, analysed water chemistry [ammonium, nitrate, soluble reactive phosphorus ({SRP}) and dissolved organic carbon ({DOC})], and measured epilithon abundance [as chlorophyll a (chl a) and ash-free dry mass ({AFDM})] in Fish Creek. Measurements were made in both the upper and lower reaches, before, during and after the major salmon runs. Absolute values and relative differences indicated that the presence of salmon spawners consistently increased dissolved ammonium (by 58 μg L-1 on average, 41× over background), {SRP} (by 6 μg L-1, 14×), epilithon chl a (by 35 mg m-2, 16×), and epilithon {AFDM} (by 3 g m-2, 8×). Salmon spawners did not increase nitrate or {DOC} in either absolute or relative amounts. The persistence and magnitude of spawner effects varied among years and appeared to reflect weather-driven hydrology as well as spawner biomass. Salmon-derived nutrients can stimulate the growth of primary producers by increasing streamwater nutrient concentrations, but this positive influence may be modulated by other factors, such as water temperature and discharge. To better assess the ecological influence of {SDN} on stream biota, future studies should explicitly consider the role of key environmental factors and their temporal and spatial dynamics in stream ecosystems. © 2007 The Authors, Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Among fish, Pacific salmon are well known to deliver large quantities of nutrients to streams as they die after spawning, but the input pathways by which iteroparous species provide nutrient subsidies have not been resolved. Our objective was to determine the importance of excretion, eggs and carcasses as nutrient sources from a large migration of longnose suckers into a stream draining a moderately agricultural catchment. Additionally, we evaluated nutrient limitation in the stream using nutrient-diffusing substrates and determined the timing of nutrient releases during egg decomposition using a microcosm experiment. Eggs were the largest component of the nitrogen (N, 57\%) and phosphorus (P, 76\%) inputs from the migration, followed by excretion by live adults (40\% N, 16\% P). Carcasses were a minor component of inputs. Estimated P inputs from fish were over three times larger than the observed export of dissolved P in this P-limited stream during the 66-day sampling period. In contrast, sucker N inputs were {\textless}2\% of dissolved N export, which was dominated by {NO}3. However, the dynamics of {NH}4concentrations through the course of the migration were closely associated with estimated {NH}4inputs from excretion and eggs. Eggs and excretion constitute significant nutrient inputs during migrations, even in catchments with elevated nutrient loads from agriculture. Mass mortality is not required for migratory fish to enhance nutrient availability in their spawning habitats. Given that sucker excretion rates and female reproductive investment are typical for freshwater fish, our results suggest that spawning migrations of iteroparous species in rivers around the world may deliver important nutrient subsidies when migrations are large.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this review is to provide a global perspective on Oncorhynchus salmonine introductions and put-and-take fisheries based on modern stocking programs, with special emphasis on freshwater ecosystems. We survey the global introductions of nine selected salmonines of the genus Oncorhynchus: golden trout, cutthroat trout, pink salmon, chum salmon, coho salmon, masu/cherry salmon, rainbow trout/ steelhead, sockeye salmon/kokanee, and chinook salmon. The information is organized on a geographical basis by continent, and then by species and chronology. Two different objectives and associated definitions of 'success' for introductions are distinguished: (a) seed introduction: release of individuals with the purpose of creating a wild-reproducing, self-sustaining population; and (b) put-and-take introduction: release of individuals with the purpose of maintaining some level of wild population abundance, regardless of wild reproduction. We identify four major phenomena regarding global salmonine introductions: (1) general inadequacy of documentation regarding introductions; (2) a fundamental disconnect between management actions and ecological consequences of introductions; (3) the importance of global climate change on success of previous and future introductions; and (4) the significance of aquaculture as a key uncertainty in accidental introductions. We conclude this review with a recognition of the need to terminate ongoing stocking programs for introduced salmonines worldwide. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

Removal of the dominant fish resulted in a significant increase in the number of smaller giant kokopu active in stream pools at night; however, no change in activity was detected by day.

Specifically, we evaluated whether decades of salmon disturbance affected patterns of aquatic insect emergence, and how both live salmon and salmon carcasses influenced the abundance of terrestrial carrion flies. Retaining wall timbers from a low-head dam on Thompson Creek were removed, providing a unique opportunity to compare stream reaches that were exposed to the immediate ecological impacts of salmon (i.e., disturbance, subsidy effects) with reaches experiencing decades of spawning activity. Using sticky traps to collect aerial insects, we observed fewer adult aquatic insects in downstream reaches conditioned to decades of salmon disturbance in comparison to naïve upstream reaches. Reduced abundance in downstream reaches was primarily driven by taxa more susceptible to disturbance in the larval life stage (e.g., Diptera: Simuliidae, Ephemeroptera). A greater abundance of adult Chironomidae midges were detected in upstream reaches with higher numbers of spawning salmon and carcasses. Though abundance of adults differed between upstream and downstream reaches, we observed no evidence of early emergence. In addition, carrion fly abundance was greatest at reaches with more live and dead salmon. Evidence from our study suggests that non-native salmon have the potential to influence patterns of aerial insect abundance in riparian zones. Our findings suggest that non-native Chinook salmon can affect aerial insect assemblages; however, the propagating effects of these changes through riparian food webs warrant further investigation.},

Salvelinus malma from the Pedro Bay ponds were the smallest for a given age, followed by Salvelinus alpinus from the lake, and S. malma from the Iliamna River were much larger. The utilization of a large sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka subsidy by the three Salvelinus spp. populations was then investigated by comparing diet data and mixing model ({MixSIR}) outputs based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. Stomach contents indicated that both S. malma populations fed on O. nerka products, especially eggs and larval Diptera that had scavenged O. nerka carcasses, whereas S. alpinus fed on a variety of prey items such as three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and snails. Stable-isotope analysis corroborated the diet data; the two S. malma populations incorporated more O. nerka-derived nutrients into their tissues than did S. alpinus from the lake, although all populations showed substantial utilization of O. nerka-derived resources. Salvelinus alpinus also seemed to be much more omnivorous, as shown by stable-isotope mixing models, than the S. malma populations. The dramatic differences in growth rate between the two S. malma populations, despite similar trophic patterns, indicate that other important genetic or environmental factors affect their life history, including proximate temperature controls and ultimate predation pressures. © 2010 The Authors.

	abstract = {A large and growing body of literature has documented the transfer of marine-derived nutrients
from the ocean to freshwater and riparian systems by semelparous Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. The
pathways by which these nutrients reach resident fish are often indirect, and the evidence for direct benefits to
the resident fish is not always conclusive. However, the consumption of salmon tissue (in one form or
another) by resident fish would constitute a direct and efficient pathway for energy transfer. We studied a
population of small-bodied, nonanadromous Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma feeding on the fry and eggs of
sockeye salmon O. nerka and blowfly (family Calliphoridae) larvae that had fed on salmon carcasses at a
series of spring-fed and otherwise unproductive ponds in southwestern Alaska. The Dolly Varden fed heavily
on sockeye salmon fry when available, shifted their diet almost exclusively to eggs after salmon spawning
commenced, and then shifted to blowfly larvae toward the end of the season. Dolly Varden large enough to
eat eggs moved into ponds where sockeye salmon spawn synchronously with the arrival of the salmon, and
Dolly Varden growth rates increased greatly once salmon eggs and blowfly maggots were available. Youngof-
the-year Dolly Varden, which were too small to eat eggs and fry, were concentrated in small streams
between ponds where fewer sockeye salmon spawn, perhaps to minimize the risk of predation from larger
conspecifics. These results indicate the importance of a pulse of salmon-related food resources for this
population of resident fish and their adaptations to take advantage of these resources. It is likely that similar
dependence occurs in other systems where sockeye salmon produce a suite of temporally predictable energy
resources; thus, resident fish may depend on large populations of salmon.},

	abstract = {Water discharge regulation can affect food availability, accessibility and vulnerability and thus, the trophic habitat suitability for lotic salmonids. To analyse brown trout habitat suitability, we therefore combined the relative importance of the food availability (overall abundance of benthic and drifting invertebrates), with the potential food vulnerability (accessibility, conspicuousness and ease of handling), the latter depending on both physical habitat characteristics (flow patterns and structural complexity of habitat) and invertebrate traits (size and other biological traits). We considered the trophic patterns of trout at two spatial scales: the reach scale (unregulated reach versus regulated reach) and the macrohabitat scale (e.g. riffles and pools). Discharge regulation reduced trout abundance, biomass, and temperature- independent growth rates. In the regulated reach, trout had a lower total prey consumption, a higher consumption of terrestrial invertebrates and a higher diet diversity than in the unregulated reach, indicating that trout were food-limited. However, the potential availability of food supplies per individual trout was similar for the two reaches. Thus, trout prey consumption in the regulated reach should have been predominantly affected by the decrease in both the availability of large invertebrates in the drift and their vulnerability in the total food supplies. There were no macrohabitat-specific differences in the total prey consumption and in the potential food availability within each reach. However, brown trout diets differed between the macrohabitats of each reach, in relation to differences in potential invertebrate vulnerability. Therefore, the potential vulnerability of invertebrates to predation was more relevant in the ecological evaluation of salmonid habitat suitability than the total food availability. The analysis at the macrohabitat scale provided a better understanding of the switches in brown trout diet and enabled a finer and more realistic analysis of trout feeding patterns. © 2002 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00442-007-0743-x},
	abstract = {Movements of prey organisms across ecosystem boundaries often subsidize consumer populations in adjacent habitats. Human disturbances such as habitat degradation or non-native species invasions may alter the characteristics or fate of these prey subsidies, but few studies have measured the direct effects of this disruption on the growth and local abundance of predators in recipient habitats. Here we present evidence, obtained from a combined experimental and comparative study in northern Japan, that an invading stream fish usurped the flux of allochthonous prey to a native fish, consequently altering the diet and reducing the growth and abundance of the native species. A large-scale field experiment showed that excluding terrestrial invertebrates that fell into the stream with a mesh greenhouse reduced terrestrial prey in diets of native Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma) by 46-70\%, and reduced their growth by 25\% over six weeks. However, when nonnative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were introduced, they monopolized these prey and caused an even greater reduction of terrestrial prey in charr diets of 82-93\%, and reduced charr growth by 31\% over the same period. Adding both greenhouse and rainbow trout treatments together produced similar results to adding either alone. Results from a comparative field study of six other stream sites in the region corroborated the experimental findings, showing that at invaded sites rainbow trout usurped the terrestrial prey subsidy, causing a more than 75\% decrease in the biomass of terrestrial invertebrates in Dolly Varden diets and forcing them to shift their foraging to insects on the stream bottom. Moreover, at sites with even low densities of rainbow trout, biomass of Dolly Varden was more than 75\% lower than at sites without rainbow trout.

	abstract = {Digestive flexibility is important because it allows an animal to maximize energy and nutrient return from the diet consumed, and also to reduce the maintenance costs associated with one of the body's most expensive systems in terms of energy and protein requirements. Two different patterns of digestive flexibility have been described for vertebrates, one for species in which metabolic costs of homeostasis are relatively high and the gut is rarely empty (e.g., mammals and birds), and one for species in which metabolic costs of homeostasis are relatively low and the gut usually spends long periods of time empty (e.g., amphibians and reptiles). In this review we analyze the information on digestive tract down-regulation during fasting in fish, in order to evaluate the extent to which digestive flexibility in fish conforms to that in other species. We found that: (1) gut size decay during long-term fasting in fish appears to be almost linear with time, even for very long fasting periods. Thus, gut size temporal dynamics in fish during long-term fasting resemble those observed in some mammals species; (2) by contrast, histological changes during fasting in fish are more similar to those described for amphibians and reptiles; and (3) data on enterocyte turnover rates indicate that cell turnover times in fish are relatively short, and although longer than those observed in mammals, they are not very different from those reported for birds. In conclusion, current data suggest that both mechanisms, cell turnover rates and change in epithelial configuration, probably are involved in digestive tract regulation in fish. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Six pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) carcass treatments (0.00, 1.45, 2.90, 4.35, 5.80, and 7.25 kg wet mass) placed in artificial channels were subsampled repeatedly for biofilm ash-free dry mass ({AFDM}), chlorophyll a, and macroinvertebrates. In a small (nonanadromous) forest stream, we sampled benthos throughout a 66-m reach 17 days after distributing 60 carcasses along the lower half of that reach. All response variables significantly increased in response to carcass additions in both artificial and natural streams. Chlorophyll a continued to increase across all loading rates, while {AFDM} and total macroinvertebrate densities showed no further response to loading beyond the first treatment (1.45 kg) in artificial streams. In the natural stream, {AFDM} and chironomid densities continued increasing across loading levels. These results indicated that increased spawner densities increased lower trophic level abundance until atrophic capacity was reached. Salmon escapement goals should consider food web effects, especially on trophic levels that support juvenile salmonids, that ultimately affect freshwater salmon production.},

This growth-mortality tradeoff has recently been incorporated into the wider framework of the pace-of- life syndrome ({POLS}) hypothesis. However, activity is often quantified only in the laboratory and on a diurnal basis, leaving open the possibility that animals manage predation risk and feeding efficiency in the wild by modulating their circadian activity rhythms. Here we investigate how laboratory activity in wild brown trout parr (Salmo trutta L.) associates with circadian activity, growth, and mortality in their natal stream. We found that individuals with high activity in the laboratory displayed high dispersal and cathemeral activity in their natal stream. In contrast, trout with low laboratory activity showed variation of activity in the wild, which was negatively related to the light intensity. Our results do not support the growth-mortality trade-off of the {POLS} hypothesis as highly active, fast-growing individuals showed higher survival than inactive conspecifics. These novel results show for the first time that active and inactive individuals, as scored in the lab, can show different circadian patterns of behavior in the wild driven by light intensity. This implies that studies conducted under a narrow range of light conditions can bias our understanding of individual behavioral variation and its fitness consequences in the wild.},

Working with Alaska Native subsistence hunters, we tagged 14 adult and 20 subadult ringed seals with satellite-linked data recorders in Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, during late-September and October 2007–2009. Information about dive and haul-out behavior in the Bering and Chukchi seas was collected for 12–297 days. We analyzed indices of dive depth, duration, and rate, and haul-out probability using a model selection framework for adults during fall (late-September–November) and winter (December–March) and for subadults during fall, winter, and also spring (April–June). We found differences by season and time of day, but not by sex. Where subadults and adults occurred together, they dove to similar depths; although subadults were commonly located in deeper waters where they generally dove deeper than adults. Both age classes dove longer during winter and subadults tended to make a few more ({\textasciitilde}3.5) dives per hour than adults. Both age classes hauled out less and dove deeper, longer, and more frequently during midday than at other times of day. We suspect that seals dive deeper during midday because their prey migrates deeper. Dive and haul-out behaviors of ringed seals are influenced by a combination of factors, including prey distribution and abundance, sea ice, and seal diving physiology.},

	abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial advances in understanding Arctic amplification - that trends and variability in surface air temperature tend to be larger in the Arctic region than for the Northern Hemisphere or globe as a whole. We provide a synthesis of research on Arctic amplification, starting with a historical context and then addressing recent insights into processes and key impacts, based on analysis of the instrumental record, modeling studies, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Arctic amplification is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation flux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic amplification are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic amplification being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic. © 2011.},

	volume = {85},
	doi = {10.1111/1365-2656.12494},
	abstract = {Declines in migratory species have been linked to anthropogenic climate change through phenological mismatch, which arises due to asynchronies between the timing of life-history events (such as migration) and the phenology of available resources. Long-distance migratory species may be particularly vulnerable to phenological change in their breeding ranges, since the timing of migration departure is based on environmental cues at distant non-breeding sites. Migrants may, however, be able to adjust migration speed en route to the breeding grounds, and thus, ability of migrants to update their timing of migration may depend critically on stopover frequency during migration; however, understanding how migratory strategy influences population dynamics is hindered by a lack of predictive models explicitly linking habitat quality to demography and movement patterns throughout the migratory cycle. Here, we present a novel modelling framework, the Migratory Flow Network ({MFN}), in which the seasonally varying attractiveness of breeding, winter and stopover regions drives the direction and timing of migration based on a simple general flux law. We use the {MFN} to investigate how populations respond to shifts in breeding site phenology based on their frequency of stopover and ability to detect and adapt to these changes. With perfect knowledge of advancing phenology, 'jump' migrants (low-frequency stopover) require more adaptation for populations to recover than 'hop' and 'skip' (high or medium frequency stopover) migrants. If adaptation depends on proximity, hop and skip migrants' populations can recover but jump migrants cannot adjust and decline severely. These results highlight the importance of understanding migratory strategies and maintaining high-quality stopover habitat to buffer migratory populations from climate-induced mismatch. We discuss how {MFNs} could be applied to diverse migratory taxa and highlight the potential of {MFNs} as a tool for exploring how migrants respond to other environmental changes such as habitat loss.},

	abstract = {Climate-mediated sea ice declines have led to alterations in ecosystem composition, phenology, and primary productivity, potentially altering trophic dynamics in Arctic marine ecosystems. As one of the Arctic’s top predators and a species dependent on sea ice habitat for survival, polar bears Ursus maritimus are at risk of habitat loss from sea ice declines, and therefore have been used to monitor the effects of climate change in the Arctic. We used stable isotope (δ15N, δ13C) values of 806 hair samples collected from Western Hudson Bay ({WH}) polar bears from 1993−1994 and 2004−2016 to examine variations in isotopic niche size and diet within the population, patterns in foraging ecology over time, and the relationship between hair isotopic values and sea ice dynamics. We found significant variation in isotopic values between age- and sex-classes. Adult males had the highest δ15N and δ13C values and the largest isotopic niches, reflecting broader diets. In contrast, adult females (with and without cubs) and subadults differed isotopi-cally from adult males, and their relatively smaller isotopic niches potentially make them more vulnerable to habitat change. Population δ15N values significantly increased over time from 1993 (mean ± {SD}: 18.8 ± 0.5) to 2016 (19.5 ± 0.7), while δ13C values significantly decreased from 1993 (−16.2 ± 0.3) until 2011 (−17.7 ± 0.2) before increasing until 2016 (−17.0 ± 0.3). Values of δ13C were significantly correlated with length of the open-water period, suggesting that this apex predator’s foraging ecology was affected by climate change. We suggest that {WH} polar bears may have undergone a significant dietary niche shift and/or that the baseline isotopic values in this ecosystem may have changed over the last 25 yr in response to climate change.},

	abstract = {Trends in Canadian temperature and precipitation during the 20th century are analyzed using recently updated and adjusted station data. Six elements, maximum, minimum and mean temperatures along with diurnal temperature range ({DTR}), precipitation totals and ratio of snowfall to total precipitation are investigated. Anomalies from the 1961-1990 reference period were first obtained at individual stations, and were then used to generate gridded datasets for subsequent trend analyses. Trends were computed for 1900-1998 for southern Canada (south of 60°N), and separately for 1950-1998 for the entire country, due to insufficient data in the high arctic prior to the 1950s. From 1900-1998, the annual mean temperature has increased between 0.5 and 1.5°C in the south. The warming is greater in minimum temperature than in maximum temperature in the first half of the century, resulting in a decrease of {DTR}. The greatest warming occurred in the west, with statistically significant increases mostly seen during spring and summer periods. Annual precipitation has also increased from 5\% to 35\% in southern Canada over the same period. In general, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has been increasing due mostly to the increase in winter precipitation which generally falls as snow and an increase of ratio in autumn. Negative trends were identified in some southern regions during spring. From 1950-1998, the pattern of temperature change is distinct: warming in the south and west and cooling in the northeast, with similar magnitudes in both maximum and minimum temperatures. This pattern is mostly evident in winter and spring. Across Canada, precipitation has increased by 5\% to 35\%, with significant negative trends found in southern regions during winter. Overall, the ratio of snowfall to total precipitation has increased, with significant negative trends occurring mostly in southern Canada during spring. Indices of abnormal climate conditions are also examined. These indices were defined as areas of Canada for 1950-1998, or southern Canada for 1900-1998, with temperature or precipitation anomalies above the 66th or below the 34th percentiles in their relevant time series. These confirmed the above findings and showed that climate has been becoming gradually wetter and warmer in southern Canada throughout the entire century, and in all of Canada during the latter half of the century.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that numerical modelling and computer simulations can be used as a powerful research tool to understand, and sometimes to predict, the tendencies and peculiarities in the dynamics of populations and ecosystems. It has been, however, much less appreciated that the context of modelling and simulations in ecology is essentially different from those that normally exist in other natural sciences. In our paper, we review the computational challenges arising in modern ecology in the spirit of computational mathematics, i.e. with our main focus on the choice and use of adequate numerical methods. Somewhat paradoxically, the complexity of ecological problems does not always require the use of complex computational methods. This paradox, however, can be easily resolved if we recall that application of sophisticated computational methods usually requires clear and unambiguous mathematical problem statement as well as clearly defined benchmark information for model validation. At the same time, many ecological problems still do not have mathematically accurate and unambiguous description, and available field data are often very noisy, and hence it can be hard to understand how the results of computations should be interpreted from the ecological viewpoint. In this scientific context, computational ecology has to deal with a new paradigm: conventional issues of numerical modelling such as convergence and stability become less important than the qualitative analysis that can be provided with the help of computational techniques. We discuss this paradigm by considering computational challenges arising in several specific ecological applications. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Data on Brown Trout population density, survival, and growth were collected from the treatment section in Hunt Creek, Michigan, where adult steelhead were stocked each spring during 1998-2003, as well as from two reference stream reaches. The presence of steelhead had no apparent effect on the density of age-0 Brown Trout, but the mean density of all age-1 and older (age-1+) Brown Trout year-classes that interacted with juvenile steelhead of the same age was 46\% lower than the density of age-1+ year-classes that did not interact with juvenile steelhead of the same age. No differences in density of age-1+ Brown Trout were detected in reference sections between the periods of steelhead presence or absence in the treatment section. Lower annual survival rates for year-classes of age-0 Brown Trout that interacted with steelhead in the Hunt Creek treatment section were the primary reason that density of age-1+ Brown Trout fell to nearly half the levels that existed before steelhead were introduced or after most steelhead had emigrated from the stream. Although our case study showed that the introduction of steelhead into a small, low-gradient stream resulted in lower densities of resident Brown Trout, upstream passage of steelhead into streams with high-quality habitat also offers tremendous potential to increase wild production of juvenile steelhead, thereby reducing fisheries managers' reliance on hatchery-reared fish for stocking the Great Lakes.Received August 16, 2013; accepted January 2, 2014. © 2014 © American Fisheries Society 2014.},

Recently, a novel twist has been added with the growing recognition that potentially competing species are often engaged in predator-prey interactions. This blend of competition and predation is called intraguild predation ({IGP}). The study of {IGP} will lead to a reconsideration of many classical topics, such as niche shifts, species exclusion and cascading interactions in food webs. Theoretical models suggest that a variety of alternative stable states are likely in {IGP} systems, and that intermediate predators should tend to be superior in exploitative competition. Many field studies support these expectations. {IGP} is also important in applied ecological problems, such as the conservation of endangered species and fisheries management. © 1992.},

The study focused on the effect of selection in fish size larger than the size where selection has been applied, and the possible effect of diet composition on the differences between lines. {FL} and {LL} trout were fed two diets differing for energy content and protein/lipid ratio during 62-days. The feeding trial (day 370 to day 432) started with 327g fish. Dietary protein and lipid contents were 58.7\% and 8.3\% dry matter ({DM}) respectively for diet D8 and 47.7\% and 26.7\% {DM} for diet D27. Growth, feed intake, feed utilization and traits related to body shape and composition were recorded. In both lines diet D27 improved growth rate, feed efficiency, protein retention and fat gain (P {\textless} 0.05), and was associated with a higher viscero-somatic index, fillet fat content and lower trimmed fillet yield than diet D8. At the end of the trial, {LL} fish were slightly heavier than {FL} ones (P = 0.02, no line × diet interaction). The main differences between lines were observed in lipid gain and retention. Values of lipid retention (\% of intake) were higher in {FL} fish (P = 0.04) regardless of diet, and suggested a greater ability of {FL} fish in de novo lipid synthesis. Fat deposition (\% of weight gain) was greater in {FL} fish during the trial and occurred in fillet (P = 0.04), on internal side of the belly flap (P = 0.04), as well as in other sites of the body, as indicated by higher overall body lipid content at day 432 (P = 0.02, no line × diet interaction). Nevertheless, carcass and fillet yields were not different between lines regardless of diet. In conclusion, selection for body weight corrected muscle fat content modified the ability of the fish to utilize nutrients and to store more or less fat in the different body sites. The differences were expressed in a large range of dietary protein/fat ratios. Line × diet interactions were recorded for a very limited number of traits, indicating that the combined use of genetic and nutritional tools should be efficient to manage carcass quality (growth, body shape, processing yields) and fat deposition (quantity and body location) in trout, with no need to adapt diet formulation according to lines. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Spatially explicit individual-based models ({IBMs}) use movement rules to determine when an animal departs its current location and to determine its movement destination; these rules are therefore critical to accurate simulations. Movement rules typically define some measure of how an individual's expected fitness varies among locations, under the assumption that animals make movement decisions at least in part to increase their fitness. Recent research shows that many fish move quickly in response to changes in physical and biological conditions, so movement rules should allow fish to rapidly select the best location that is accessible. The theory that a fish's fitness is maximized by minimizing the ratio of mortality risk to food intake is not applicable to typical {IBM} movement decisions and can cause serious errors in common situations. Instead, we developed fitness measures from unified foraging theory that are theoretically and computationally compatible with individual-based fish models. One such fitness measure causes a fish to select habitat that maximizes its expected probability of survival over a specified time horizon, considering both starvation and other risks. This fitness measure is dependent on the fish's current state, making fish with low energy reserves more willing to accept risks in exchange for higher food intake. Another new measure represents the expectation of reaching reproductive maturity by multiplying expected survival by a factor indicating how close to the size of first reproduction the fish grows within the time horizon. One of the primary benefits of the individual-based approach is avoiding the need for simplifying assumptions; this benefit is best realized by basing movement decisions on such simple, direct measures of fitness as expected survival and expected reproductive maturity.},

However, differences among tissues which occur in consumers such as fish may confound resolution of these ecological relationships, and greatly affect dietary compositions calculated through mass-balance equations. 2. δ13C and δ15N were determined for homogenized whole fry (≃ 2 · 7 g) and particular tissues (white muscle, red muscle, liver and heart) of juveniles (≃ 20 · 6 g) of Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss 3. Differences in δ13c and δ15N were observed among tissues; removal of lipid resulted in these tissues becoming statistically indistinguishable but more variable in δ13C, particularly in tissues with higher lipid content. Differences in δ15N among tissues may be related to the relative composition of 'essential' and 'non-essential' amino acids. 5. Acidification, which is used to reduce variability caused by the presence of inorganic carbonate, had a significant effect on δ15N, while having a non-significant effect on the δ13C. This was the case for whole ground fish-fry, which contained 22 · 6\% inorganic carbonates in the form of bones and scales, and for individual fish tissues which contained only very small amounts of inorganic carbonate, 6. White muscle was found to be less variable in δ13C and δ15N than all other tissues, and is probably the best tissue for use in ecological work. Red muscle, which is often closely associated with White muscle, is more variable in δ13C and may constitute a source of significant error in source material identification and dietary overlap.},

The study revealed that M. cordyla categorically feeds on fish (40.62\%), digested matter (27.81\%), crustaceans (23.39\%), mollusks (6.31\%), polychaetes (1.11\%) and coelenterates (0.76\%). The index of relative importance ({IRI}) and absolute index ({AI}) were applied to estimate main food item consumed by the fish. The males preferred Acetes spp. and female mainly fishes. The feeding rate during post monsoon was relatively higher which was deduced from the number of full stomachs, whereas lower number of prey items was observed during post monsoon followed by pre monsoon. The stumpy feeding was observed during monsoon when most of the stomachs were empty. The gastrosomatic index estimates showed that females feed enormously in May followed by September, while in males high feeding rate was observed in April and June.

We sampled juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) during spring and fall from 11 south-central Alaskan streams that ranged widely in spawning salmon biomass (0.1-4.7 kg·m -2). Growth rate (as indexed by {RNA}-{DNA} ratios), energy density, and δ 15 N enrichment in spring-sampled fishes increased with spawner biomass, indicating the persistence of spawner effects more than 6 months after salmon spawning. Point estimates suggest that spawner effects on nutrition were substantially greater for coho salmon than Dolly Varden (268\% and 175\% greater for growth and energy, respectively), indicating that both species benefitted physiologically, but that juvenile coho salmon accrued more benefits than Dolly Varden. Although the data were less conclusive for fall- than spring-sampled fish, they do suggest spawner effects were also generally positive during fall, soon after salmon spawned. In a follow-up analysis where growth rate and energy density were modeled as a function of δ 15 N enrichment, results suggested that both increased with {MDN} assimilation, especially in juvenile coho salmon.

adaptations to fasting and starvation. When deprived of food, animals employ various
behavioral, physiological, and structural responses to reduce metabolism, which
prolongs the period in which energy reserves can cover metabolism. Such behavioral
responses can include a reduction in spontaneous activity and a lowering in body temperature,
although in later stages of food deprivation in which starvation commences,
activity may increase as food-searching is activated. In most animals, the gastrointestinal
tract undergoes marked atrophy when digestive processes are curtailed; this structural
response and others seem particularly pronounced in species that normally feed
at intermittent intervals. Such animals, however, must be able to restore digestive functions
soon after feeding, and these transitions appear to occur at low metabolic costs.},

	abstract = {Flexible phenotypes enable animals to live in environments that change over space and time, and knowing the limits to and the required time scale for this flexibility provides insights into constraints on energy and nutrient intake, diet diversity and niche width. We quantified the level of immediate and ultimate spare capacity, and thus the extent of phenotypic flexibility, in the digestive system of a migratory bird in response to increased energy demand, and identified the digestive constraints responsible for the limits on sustained energy intake. Immediate spare capacity decreased from approximately 50\% for birds acclimated to relatively benign temperatures to less than 20\% as birds approached their maximum sustainable energy intake. Ultimate spare capacity enabled an increase in feeding rate of approximately 126\% as measured in birds acclimated for weeks at -29°C compared with +21°C. Increased gut size and not tissue-specific differences in nutrient uptake or changes in digestive efficiency or retention time were primarily responsible for this increase in capacity with energy demand, and this change required more than 1-2 days. Thus, the pace of change in digestive organ size may often constrain energy intake and, for birds, retard the pace of their migration. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Some organisms use behavioral or physiological modifications that leave no permanent trace in the genes of future generations. Others withstand environmental change through the regular production of diverse offspring, in which the diversity can be either genetic or nongenetic. Evolutionary theorists now have the opportunity to catch up with the empirical evolutionary biology, and to integrate the diverse forms of 'adaptive variation' into a single conceptual framework. Here, we propose a classification according to the level at which the adaptive variation occurs and discuss some of the mechanisms underlying the variation. This perspective unites independent lines of research in molecular biology, microbiology, macroevolution, ecology, immunology and neurobiology, and suggests directions for a more comprehensive theory of adaptive variation.},

Here we examined how territoriality and nest-digging by anadromous salmon mediate trophic subsidies to stream fishes. Salmon eggs become available for consumption primarily by the digging of salmon that superimpose their nests on previous nests. An individual-based model of spawning salmon predicted that territoriality and habitat saturation produce a nonlinear effect of salmon density on numbers of available eggs to resident predators. Field studies in Alaskan streams found that higher densities of salmon produce disproportionately more eggs in stream drift and in diets of resident fishes (Arctic grayling and rainbow trout). Bioenergetics model simulations indicated that these subsidies produce substantially enhanced growth rates of trout. These results demonstrate that small changes in salmon abundance can drive large changes in subsidies to stream food webs. Thus, the ecological consequences of population declines of keystone species, such as salmon, will be exacerbated when behavior generates nonlinear impacts.},

To better understand the processes influencing the expression of these phenotypes we examined the influences of growth in length (fork length) and whole body lipid content in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Fish were sampled from the John Day River basin in northeast Oregon where both anadromous ("steelhead") and freshwater resident rainbow trout coexist. Larger males with higher lipid levels had a greater probability of maturing as a resident at age-1+. Among males, 38\% were maturing overall, and the odds ratios of the logistic model indicated that the probability of a male maturing early as a resident at age-1+ increased 49\% (95\% confidence interval ({CI}) = 23-81\%) for every 5 mm increase in length and 33\% (95\% {CI} = 10-61\%) for every 0. 5\% increase in whole body lipid content. There was an inverse association between individual condition and water temperature as growth was greater in warmer streams while whole body lipid content was higher in cooler streams.

Whereas spawning sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) dig nests that cover over 2 m2 and are at least 20 cm deep, and can spawn at high densities, relatively little attention has been devoted to investigating the impacts of this disturbance. We hypothesized that this temporally and spatially predictable bioturbation has large impacts on the coastal aquatic habitats used by sockeye. We experimentally investigated the impacts of disturbance caused by spawning sockeye in two streams and two lakes in Alaska by excluding salmon from 2.25 m2 plots where they traditionally spawn. We sampled exclusions and control plots before, during, and after spawning. During sockeye spawning, fine sediment accumulated in areas where sockeye were excluded from spawning. In addition, sockeye spawning significantly decreased algal biomass by 80\% compared to exclusion plots. We found mixed effects of spawning on the invertebrate assemblage. Tricladida and Chironomidae densities increased by 3x in exclusion plots relative to control plots in one creek site. However, for most taxa and sites, invertebrate densities declined substantially as spawning progressed, regardless of experimental treatment.

These ecosystem engineers have local impacts on benthic habitat and also strongly affect downstream fluxes of nutrients and other resources. The impacts of ecosystem engineers are most likely some function of their behavior, size, and population density, modulated by the abiotic conditions of the stream. In streams, subsidies often control the body size and density of ecosystem engineers, while hydrologic energy controls their distribution, density, and life-history attributes, the habitats they create, and the resources and organisms they affect. Because ecosystem engineers can profoundly affect stream ecosystems, and because they themselves can be significantly affected positively or negatively by human activities, understanding ecosystem engineering in streams is increasingly important for the management of these ecosystems.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2656.12045},
	abstract = {Animal movements are the primary behavioural adaptation to spatiotemporal heterogeneity in resource availability. Depending on their spatiotemporal scale, movements have been categorized into distinct functional groups (e.g. foraging movements, dispersal, migration), and have been studied using different methodologies. We suggest striving towards the development of a coherent framework based on the ultimate function of all movement types, which is to increase individual fitness through an optimal exploitation of resources varying in space and time. We developed a novel approach to simultaneously study movements at different spatiotemporal scales based on the following proposed theory: the length and frequency of animal movements are determined by the interaction between temporal autocorrelation in resource availability and spatial autocorrelation in changes in resource availability. We hypothesized that for each time interval the spatiotemporal scales of moose Alces alces movements correspond to the spatiotemporal scales of variation in the gains derived from resource exploitation when taking into account the costs of movements (represented by their proxies, forage availability {NDVI} and snow depth respectively). The scales of change in {NDVI} and snow were quantified using wave theory, and were related to the scale of moose movement using linear mixed models. In support of the proposed theory we found that frequent, smaller scale movements were triggered by fast, small-scale ripples of changes, whereas infrequent, larger scale movements matched slow, large-scale waves of change in resource availability. Similarly, moose inhabiting ranges characterized by larger scale waves of change in the onset of spring migrated longer distances. We showed that the scales of movements are driven by the scales of changes in the net profitability of trophic resources. Our approach can be extended to include drivers of movements other than trophic resources (e.g. population density, density of related individuals, predation risk) and may facilitate the assessment of the impact of environmental changes on community dynamics and conservation. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) accumulate substantial nutrients in their bodies as they grow to adulthood at sea. These nutrients are carried to predominantly oligotrophic lakes and streams, where they are released during and after spawning. Research over more than 3 decades has shown that the annual deposition of salmon-borne marine-derived nutrients ({MD}-nutrients) is important for the productivity of freshwater communities throughout the Pacific coastal region. However, the pathways and mechanisms for {MD}-nutrient transfer and accumulation in freshwater and riparian ecosystems remain virtually unexplored, consequently, there are many uncertainties in this area. This article addresses three related topics. First, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the linkages among {MD}-nutrients, freshwater (including riparian) ecosystems, and community dynamics by addressing the importance of {MD}-nutrients to lakes and streams and by then reviewing large-scale and long-term processes in the atmosphere and ocean that govern variability in salmon populations. Second, we evaluate the validity of the discoveries and their implications for active ecosystem management, noting areas where extrapolation from these results still requires great caution. Finally, we outline five key research issues where additional discoveries could greatly augment our understanding of the processes shaping the structure and dynamics of salmon populations and the characteristics of their freshwater habitat and associated riparian zones. Collectively, the data suggest that the freshwater portion of the salmon production system is intimately linked to the ocean. Moreover, for the system to be sustainable, a holistic approach to management will be required. This holistic approach will need to treat climate cycles, salmon, riparian vegetation, predators, and {MD}-nutrient flowpaths and feedbacks as an integrated system.},

There were no differences in visceral fat or hepatosomatic indices, but within-treatment variation was high.

	abstract = {Overwinter growth of young-of-the-year (age-0) Atlantic salmon Salmo salar was studied during two winters in central New York streams. We hypothesized that longer and colder winters would negatively influence the growth of age-0 Atlantic salmon. Further, we predicted that Atlantic salmon growth and survival would be positively correlated with their size before the winter period. Four cages were placed in streams at three sites in the winters of 2000 and 200 1, with six individually marked Atlantic salmon per cage. One cage was retrieved monthly at each site and the weight, length, and energy density of each fish were measured to calculate growth rate and condition factor. All fish survived the winter experiment irrespective of starting size. Mean energy density of fish at the conclusion of each experiment was positively related to fish weight at the start. Winter conditions were different between years, stream temperatures being colder in 2000 than in 2001 (overall winter mean [{SD}], 0.71 degrees C [2.487 degrees C] versus 1.93 degrees C [2.87 degrees C]), accompanied by less variable temperatures, lower discharge, and more ice cover. Growth rates were negative during both winters, weight loss being significantly greater in the year with wanner, more variable temperatures. Growth rates were also significantly different between months, weight loss being greater in December and January and less (or replaced by positive growth) by the end of the winters (March). Mean energy density of salmon increased during the colder winter of 2000 but declined in 2001. Based on the observations in the current study, lower threshold temperatures for feeding activity may be even lower than previously reported, possibly near 0 degrees C.

	abstract = {The important contribution of terrestrial invertebrates to the energy budget of drift-foraging fishes has been well documented in many forested headwater streams. However, relatively little attention has been focused on the behavioral mechanisms behind such intensive exploitation. We tested for the hypothesis that active prey selection by fishes would be an important determinant of terrestrial invertebrates contribution to fish diets in a forested headwater stream in northern Japan. Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were estimated to consume 57.12 mg m-2 day-1 (dry mass) terrestrial invertebrates, 77\% of their total input (73.89 mg m-2 day-1), there being high selectivity for the former from stream drift. Both the falling input and drift of terrestrial invertebrates peaked at around dusk, decreasing dramatically toward midnight. In contrast, both aquatic insect adults and benthic invertebrates showed pronounced nocturnal drift. Because the prey consumption rates of rainbow trout were high at dawn and dusk, decreasing around midnight, the greater contribution of terrestrial invertebrates to trout diet was regarded as being partly influenced by the difference in diel periodicity of availability among prey categories. In addition, selectivity also depended upon differences in individual prey size among aquatic insect adults, and benthic and terrestrial invertebrates, the last category being largest in both the stream drift and the trout diets. We concluded that differences in both the timing of supplies and prey size among the three prey categories were the primary factors behind the selective foraging on terrestrial invertebrates by rainbow trout.},

Such effects imply a converse impact when adult abundance is severely reduced by fishing: increases in forage species may then cause lagged, apparently depensatory decreases in juvenile survival. Depensatory effects can then delay or prevent stock rebuilding. Cultivation effects are apparently common in freshwater communities and may also explain low recruitment success following Severe declines of some major marine stocks such as Newfoundland Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Risk of depensatory effects should be a major target of recruitment research, and management policies should aim for considerably higher spawning abundances than has previously been assumed necessary based on recruitment data collected during adult stock declines associated with fishery development.},

We reared Chinook salmon from three populations in a common-garden hatchery study at 6.5, 9.4, and 15.2°C and measured a variety of fitness-related traits during development. We found that most of the among-population variation in early life history traits was explained by egg size. However, the contribution of egg size to the among-population variation decreased with an increase in temperature suggesting that other effects, such as genetic, contribute at high temperature. Within populations, egg size explained much of the dam variance and maternal effect for traits in every temperature, whereas egg size generally had little to no influence on the sire variance and heritability. Overall, our results demonstrate the significant contribution egg size makes to shaping early life history phenotypes among and within populations, and suggest that egg size is an important pathway through which offspring phenotypes can evolve on contemporary timescales.},

analyzing proportional data in ecology, with applications in data sets containing binomial and

higher power than analyses of transformed data. However, it is important to check the data
for additional unexplained variation, i.e., overdispersion, and to account for it via the
inclusion of random effects in the model if found. For non-binomial data, the arcsine
transform is undesirable on the grounds of interpretability, and because it can produce
nonsensical predictions. The logit transformation is proposed as an alternative approach to
address these issues. Examples are presented in both cases to illustrate these advantages,
comparing various methods of analyzing proportions including untransformed, arcsine- and
logit-transformed linear models and logistic regression (with or without random effects).
Simulations demonstrate that logistic regression usually provides a gain in power over other methods.},

	abstract = {Criteria used to characterize lotic salmonid habitat suitability are often based on correlations between physical habitat characteristics and salmonid abundance. Focusing on physical habitat features ignores other habitat components, such as an adequate food supply, that limit the amount of energy available for growth and survival. We tested the degree that food availability and temperature influence lotic salmonid consumption and growth rates and outline an approach for assessing habitat quality based on measurements of these features. We collected benthic and drifting invertebrate abundances, stream temperatures, and juvenile steelhead - rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) summer growth rates among nine stream segments in central Oregon. Stream temperatures and growth rates were used in bioenergetics model simulations to estimate O. mykiss consumption rates. The variation in O. mykiss consumption rates was explained by measurements of total drift biomass along a type {II} predator response curve (R2 = 0.71). This simplified foraging relationship between food abundance and consumption is then used to estimate the consumption component of the bioenergetics model to allow estimation of salmonid growth potential. Validation of the growth potential model produced reasonably accurate estimates of fish growth rates at reaches within the study area and precise but biased estimates in novel systems. While additional reach-level habitat information may be required to make the model more generalizable, the assessment of invertebrate food availability offers a simple yet powerful approach for describing the growth potential of stream habitat.},

Brook trout declined after severe floods, recovered, declined again after an extreme sedimentation,
and continued to decline while brown trout increased. Brook trout biomass, initially at 184 kg/
ha, decreased to 4 kg/ha at the end of the period, a reduction of 98\%. Rainbow trout entered the
study section when floods overflowed private ponds, but their population did not reach high levels.
After its entrance, the brown trout increased to predominate the trout fauna with a final biomass
of 201 kg/ha. At the end of the study period, brook trout biomass remained at 2\% of all trout
species, rainbow trout at 5\%, and brown trout at 93\%. Maximum annual production by brook
trout, near the beginning of the 21-year period, was 171 kg/ha. Annual production had declined
to only 9 kg/ha (3\% of all-trout production) by the end of the study. Rainbow trout annual
production remained low at 8 kg/ha (2\%) by the end of the study. Annual production by brown
trout increased to 322 kg/ha (95\%). Density and mean annual biomass varied similarly over the
study period. The ratio of annual production to mean annual biomass (P:B) varied with species,
reflecting length of life span: 1.4 for brook trout and rainbow trout, and 1.2 for brown trout.
Annual P:B ratios varied among age-groups, being highest for younger fish. The importance of
long-term studies was emphasized by results of the severe environmental disturbances that ensued
during the 21-year period. The selection of any 1- or 2-year period for study would not have
produced an accurate representation of the stream’s long-term biological status.},

subjected to three distinct feeding regimes at two temperatures were used to evaluate the ability of two
bioenergetics models to predict fish growth. Accuracy of cumulative consumption predictions was also tested
for one of the models. Consumption-dependent prediction error has been commonly observed in bioenergetics
models for other fish species; model errors for predicting relative growth rate of individual fish were regressed
on observed mean daily consumption rate to assess whether the two bioenergetics models exhibited this type
of error. Both models yielded unbiased estimates of brown trout growth that were within 1–12\% of observed
values across the range of fish sizes, water temperatures, and ration levels tested. For regressions of predicted
versus observed final weight, the Bonferroni joint 95\% confidence intervals for slope included 1 and
confidence intervals for the y-intercept included 0 for both models. No significant intermodel differences in
percent error for predicting final weight of fish in feeding trials were observed. Predicted cumulative
consumption values were within 8–15\% of corresponding observed values. Neither model exhibited
significant consumption-dependent error for predicting brown trout growth, in contrast to results of several
previous laboratory evaluations of bioenergetics models for other fish species. Absence of consumptiondependent
error in the two brown trout models may be a result of (1) incorporating feeding rate dependence of
egestion and excretion into these models and (2) using egestion and excretion parameters that were not
borrowed from other species. Results of this evaluation corroborate the utility of these bioenergetics models
for predicting growth and consumption for brown trout under the range of fish sizes, water temperatures, and

increase the growth rates of stream-resident salmonids in southeastern Alaska and that more

(0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 carcasses/m2 or 0, 1.9, 3.7, 5.6, and 7.4 kg wet mass/m2) were replicated
six times in once-through artificial channels, then each channel was stocked with three live age-
0 coho salmon O. kisutch. The experiment spanned more than 9 weeks: 16 August to 24 October
1998. The body mass and fork length of the young coho salmon significantly increased from
carcass additions, but the incremental increases sharply diminished at carcass-loading levels above
1 carcass/m2. Further, in a small stream in which we added salmon carcasses to a cumulative
density of 0.54 carcasses/m2, both cutthroat trout O. clarki and Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma
grew significantly faster during the 2 months in which carcasses were added (September–October)
compared with fish in control reaches. Fish maintained their assimilated body mass through winter
into the following spring. This study illustrates that marine nutrients and energy from salmon
spawners increase growth rates of resident and anadromous salmonids in streams. This elevated
growth should translate into increased survival and reproduction, ultimately elevating freshwater
and marine salmon production. Ecological relationships between salmon runs and aquatic community
nutrition and productivity may be important considerations for salmon stock protection
and restoration and for freshwater and marine ecosystem management.},

	abstract = {The combination of large body size, carnivory and endothermic costs leads to high caloric demands in many mammalian predators. Tactics used to capture prey to meet these demands vary among mammals, and ranges from prolonged tracking to high-speed chases. Furthermore, accessibility to air differs for species that hunt in water or on land. To determine the behavioral and energetic consequences of these different foraging methods and habitats, we measured the energetic cost of hunting, energy acquired from ingested prey, and patterns of energy acquisition in free-ranging Weddell seals (body mass=461 kg) and sea otters (mass=25 kg). The values were then compared to terrestrial predators ranging in mass from 25 to 170 kg. We found that foraging dive duration was 2.4±0.4 min for otters and 16.3±0.6 min for seals, and that dives were interspersed with short to moderate duration rest periods. In contrast, large terrestrial mammals hunted in one to two sessions per day that lasted several hours. The efficiency of an individual hunting event ranged from 3.8 in the sea otter to 10.2 for Weddell seals. This compared to 2.2 for African wild dogs and 3.8 for African lions feeding on ungulates. In general, adaptations for marine living including elevated basal metabolic rates and the dive response represent major influences on hunting efficiency that is further modified by the energetic cost of specific hunting tactics. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {We evaluated the response of benthic macroinvertebrates in a Michigan trout stream to flow reduction by diverting water from a 602 m reach of Hunt Creek from June through August of 1994, 1997 and 1998. We also assessed the utility of the Physical Habitat Simulation system ({PHABSIM}) in predicting the response of benthic insects to water withdrawals by testing the assumption of a positive linear relationship between modelled habitat (weighted usable area, {WUA}) and the density of 13 benthic insect families. Our findings showed that the density of filter feeding and grazing insect taxa, as well as insects classified as obligate erosional zone taxa, declined significantly in the dewatered (treatment) zone ({TZ}) when 90\% of flow was diverted. Density of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera ({EPT}) taxa in the {TZ} was significantly lower when 90\% of water was diverted as compared to density at baseflow or when flow was reduced by 50\%. The density of all insects in an upstream reference zone riffle ({RZ}), where flow was not altered, did not change among experimental periods. Although overall reductions in the density of benthic insects at 90\% flow reduction coincided with lower {PHABSIM} predictions of {WUA}, we found poor linear correlation between {WUA} at different flows and the density of the 13 benthic insect families for which {WUA} was modelled. The low proportion of variation explained by {WUA} for all families modelled suggests that {WUA} alone is not an accurate predictor of benthic insect density. Resource managers should consider the potential consequences of water withdrawals to all components of stream communities, including benthic macroinvertebrates. However, caution should be applied when using the {PHABSIM} technique in groundwater-fed streams such as Hunt Creek, because most relationships between {WUA} and benthic insect density were insignificant.

To fully comprehend energy flow through elasmobranchs in marine communities it is necessary not only to know what they eat, but also to characterize the rates at which they ingest, digest, and process energy and nutrients contained in prey that is consumed. As with other areas of elasmobranch biology, investigations on dynamics of feeding and processing food lag behind such studies on other marine fishes and vertebrates. By far the most common elasmobranch feeding studies simply describe stomach contents of a particular species in a particular location. Rate of consumption, feeding patterns, and the fate of food once ingested have been examined for very few species of elasmobranchs.},

Data from pan-traps placed on stream surfaces showed that {TI} biomass and nitrogen inputs averaged up to 66 and 6 mg · m-2 · day-1, respectively, with no significant difference between habitats. Stomach contents from coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), cutthroat trout (O. clarki), and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) revealed that {TI} and aquatic-derived invertebrates ({AI}) were equally important prey. Additionally, salmonids from young-growth systems ingested a greater {TI} proportion than those from old-growth systems. There were trends but no significant differences between habitats of {TI} and {AI} biomass ingested; however, statistical power was {\textless}0.30. These results showed that {TI} were important juvenile salmonid prey and that a riparian overstory with more alder and denser shrub understory may increase their abundance.

These behaviors were studied to determine the bases for prey selection by salmon in Lake Michigan and ultimately facilitate predictions on shifts or changes in salmon diets. Chinook and coho salmon captured all prey items in the open water portion of the aquarium, and they had similar attack behaviors. Average attack swimming speeds varied from 2.6 to 3.6 m/s, and average escape swimming speeds varied from 2.6 to 2.9 m/s. There were no significant differences in attack swimming speeds and escape swimming speeds. There was a significant difference in median reactive distances between the prey captured and those that escaped. There was no reactive distance (0.00 m) for 96\% and 98\% of the successfully captured prey by chinook and coho salmon, respectively. Only 4\% and 10\% of the unsuccessful attacks by chinook and coho salmon, respectively, had no reactive distance (0.00 m). Salmon would repeatedly attack a school and capture individuals separated from the school. Alewives, bloaters and fathead minnows were easy prey because they remained in the open water portion of the aquarium and stayed in schools until only a few individuals remained. The schooling behavior of spottail shiners and emerald shiners was an effective anti-predation tactic against salmon attacks. After some experience with yellow perch, salmon were reluctant to attack them and would often break off attacks on them. When coho salmon were presented with different proportions of bloaters and yellow perch, they significantly attacked and captured bloaters in preference to yellow perch. © Munksgaard, 1997.},

	abstract = {Understanding spatial physical habitat selection driven by competition and/or predator–prey interactions of mobile marine species is a fundamental goal of spatial ecology. However, spatial counts or density data for highly mobile animals often (1) include excess zeros, (2) have spatial correlation, and (3) have highly nonlinear relationships with physical habitat variables, which results in the need for complex joint spatial models. In this paper, we test the use of Bayesian hierarchical hurdle and zero-inflated joint models with integrated nested Laplace approximation ({INLA}), to fit complex joint models to spatial patterns of eight mobile marine species (grey seal, harbor seal, harbor porpoise, common guillemot, black-legged kittiwake, northern gannet, herring, and sandeels). For each joint model, we specified nonlinear smoothed effect of physical habitat covariates and selected either competing species or predator–prey interactions. Out of a range of six ecologically important physical and biologic variables that are predicted to change with climate change and large-scale energy extraction, we identified the most important habitat variables for each species and present the relationships between these bio/physical variables and species distributions. In particular, we found that net primary production played a significant role in determining habitat preferences of all the selected mobile marine species. We have shown that the {INLA} method is well-suited for modeling spatially correlated data with excessive zeros and is an efficient approach to fit complex joint spatial models with nonlinear effects of covariates. Our approach has demonstrated its ability to define joint habitat selection for both competing and prey–predator species that can be relevant to numerous issues in the management and conservation of mobile marine species.},

	abstract = {Physical characteristics of riverine habitats, such as large wood abundance, pool geometry and abundance, riparian vegetation cover, and surface flow conditions, have traditionally been thought to constrain fish production in these ecosystems. Conversely, the role of food resources (quantity and quality) in controlling fish production has received far less attention and consideration, though they can also be key productivity drivers. Traditional freshwater food web illustrations have typically conveyed the notion that most fish food is produced within the local aquatic habitat itself, but the concepts and model we synthesize in this article show that most fish food comes from external or very distant sources?including subsidies from marine systems borne from adult returns of anadromous fishes, from fishless headwater tributaries that transport prey to downstream fish, and from adjacent streamside vegetation and associated habitats. The model we propose further illustrates how key trophic pathways and food sources vary through time and space throughout watersheds. Insights into how food supplies affect fishes can help guide how we view riverine ecosystems, their structure and function, their interactions with marine and terrestrial systems, and how we manage natural resources, including fish, riparian habitats, and forests. las características físicas de los hábitats fluviales, tales como abundancia de madera, geometría y abundancia de cuerpos de agua, cobertura de vegetación riparia y condiciones de flujo superficial han sido comúnmente consideradas como determinantes de la producción de peces en este tipo de ecosistemas. Alternativamente, el papel del suministro alimenticio (calidad y cantidad) en el control de la producción de peces ha recibido mucha menos atención y consideración pese a que también puede ser un elemento clave en cuanto al control de la productividad. Las clásicas ilustraciones de redes alimenticias de ambientes de agua dulce han dado la impresión de que la mayor parte del alimento de los peces se produce dentro del propio hábitat acuático local, pero los conceptos y el modelo que se presentan en este artículo muestran que gran parte del alimento de los peces proviene de fuentes externas o muy distantes ?incluyendo subsidios por parte de los sistemas marinos como el retorno de adultos de peces anádromos, tributarios paralelos que transportan las presas hacia los peces que habitan río abajo, vegetación ribereña y hábitats asociados. El modelo que se propone, además, explica cómo las vías tróficas clave y los suministros alimenticios, varían a través del tiempo y del espacio entre cuencas. El conocimiento de cómo los suministros de alimento afectan a los peces, puede ayudar a mejorar la forma en la que se estudian los ecosistemas fluviales, a entender su estructura y función, sus interacciones con sistemas marinos y terrestres y a optimizar el manejo de los recursos naturales, incluyendo peces, hábitats riparios y forestales.},

Food consumption (dry weight) was affected in a similar manner for both diets and its maximum occurred at slightly higher frequency than for maximum growth. No effects of feeding frequency or type of diet on energy retention efficiency were observed (mean 42.5\% of gross energy) but protein efficiency decreased with more frequent feedings.

Based on a suite of 11 microsatellite markers, we examine the relationship between Nb, Ne and census population size (Nc) in 14 brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations inhabiting 12 small streams in Nova Scotia and sampled at least twice between 2009 and 2015. Unbiased estimates of Nb obtained with individuals of a single cohort, adjusted on the basis of age at first maturation (a) and adult lifespan ({AL}), were from 1.66 to 0.24 times the average estimates of Ne obtained with random samples of individuals of mixed ages (i.e. Nb(adj2)=mean (Ne(mixed ages))). In turn, these differences led to adjusted Ne estimates that were from nearly five to 0.7 times the estimates derived from mixed-aged individuals. These differences translate into the same range of variation in the ratio of effective to census population size (Ne(adj2)= Nc) within populations. Adopting Ne(adj2) as the more precise and unbiased estimates, we found that these brook trout populations differ markedly in their effective to census population sizes (range {approX}.0.3 to {approX}.0.01). Using {AGENE}, we then showed that the variance in reproductive success or reproductive skew varied among populations by a factor of 40, from Vk/k ≈ 5 to 200. These results suggest wide differences in population dynamics, probably resulting from differences in productivity affecting the intensity of competition for access to mates or redds, and thus reproductive skew. Understanding the relationship between Ne, Nb and Nc, and how these relate to population dynamics and fluctuations in population size, are important for the design of robust conservation strategies in small populations with overlapping generations and iteroparity.},

	abstract = {1. Anadromous salmon transport marine-derived nutrients and carbon to freshwater and riparian ecosystems upon their return to natal spawning systems. The ecological implications of these subsidies on the trophic ecology of resident fish remain poorly understood despite broad recognition of their potential importance. 2. We studied the within-year changes in the ration size, composition and stable isotope signature of the diets of two resident salmonids (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; Arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus) before and after the arrival of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) to their spawning grounds in the Bristol Bay region of southwest Alaska. 3. Ration size and energy intake increased by 480-620\% for both species after salmon arrived. However, the cause of the increases differed between species such that rainbow trout switched to consuming salmon eggs, salmon flesh and blowflies that colonized salmon carcasses, whereas grayling primarily ate more benthic invertebrates that were presumably made available because of physical disturbances by spawning salmon. 4. We also observed an increase in the δ15N of rainbow trout diets post-salmon, but not for grayling. This presumably led to the observed increase in the δ15N of rainbow trout with increasing body mass, but not for grayling. 5. Using a bioenergetics model, we predicted that salmon-derived resources contributed a large majority of the energy necessary for growth in this resident fish community. Furthermore, the bioenergetics model also showed how seasonal changes in diet affected the stable isotope ratios of both species. These results expand upon a growing body of literature that highlights the different pathways whereby anadromous salmon influence coastal ecosystems, particularly resident fish. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Information on the energy density of juvenile fishes is needed to inform food web and bioenergetic models. Several approaches may be used to estimate energy density, and although these approaches are expected to yield similar estimates, the accuracy of such estimates has not been assessed. Estuarine fishes have unique life history strategies that influence the water, protein, lipid, and ash composition of their tissues. Because proximate components vary among species, the preferred approaches for estimating energy density from these components may also differ. We investigated the suitability of five approaches to estimate energy density measured by bomb calorimetry from water content for juvenile Summer Flounder Paralichthys dentatus, Striped Bass Morone saxatilis, and Atlantic Croaker Micropogonias undulatus. Approaches were based on the following: (1) relationships between water and percent composition, (2) relationships between water and the mass of proximate components, (3) water content alone (by percentage and by mass), (4) percent water and fish mass, and (5) published relationships between energy density and percent dry weight. The mean predicted energy densities from alternative approaches were generally within 10\% of the mean energy densities measured by bomb calorimetry (4.21 {kJ}/g to 4.94 {kJ}/g). For Summer Flounder and Atlantic Croakers, regressions based on the percent water from whole fish provided estimates of energy density closest to those from bomb calorimetry, and including fish mass improved the accuracy of energy density estimates for Striped Bass. Energy density calculated from percent composition overestimated measured energy density, even with conservative lipid-to-energy conversion factors; this was most pronounced for individuals with energy densities less than 5 {kJ}/g. Because lipid-to-energy conversion factors may not be temporally stable or spatially invariant, further research is needed on the energy content of lipid classes in fishes. The types of lipids used for energy storage likely vary among life stages and species, and extrapolating approaches to different size-classes or species groups may bias estimates of energy content.

Invertebrate drift rate, drift density and trout stomach fullness were significantly greater in June than August samples. Diets were dominated by aquatic-derived prey (chironomid larvae and adult blackflies) in June, but terrestrial invertebrates were the most frequent diet items in August. Consistent occupancy of low-velocity, deep microhabitats with low invertebrate flux rates indicated that, despite variation in habitat and prey conditions, trout adopted a habitat-use strategy of minimising risks and energy costs rather than maximising forage gain. This observation is consistent with, and provides a potential explanation for, the low summer growth rates of brook trout observed in small streams. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Brown trout were sampled from 1996, when turbidity was 26 {NTU}, to 2001 when turbidity was 141 {NTU}. The mean relative volume of stomach contents decreased progressively to 2001, by which time it was only one sixth of that in 1996, and the mean diversity of prey in stomachs decreased from an average of more than six species per stomach in 1996 to one species in 2001. The species composition of stomach contents shifted from domination by the phreatoicid isopod Colubotelson sp., to the galaxiid fish Galaxias auratus and the amphipod Austrochiltonia australis, and then the cladoceran Daphnia carinata. To give an indication of diet changes over a typical yearly cycle in the current turbid state of the lake, a sample was taken from each season from December 2000 to September 2001. Two basic diets were found during the year; brown trout specialized on D. carinata in summer and autumn, and G. auratus in winter and spring. Mean diversity of prey was less than two species per stomach in all samples from 2000 to 2001, except for the sample from spring 2001 when it was 2.2 species per stomach, and the mean relative volume of stomach contents was more than three times greater in winter than any other season. The ways in which high turbidity may have influenced the changes in the brown trout diet observed since 1996 and the patterns evident during the seasons of 2000-2001 are discussed. © 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

Rainbow smelt were first observed in Lake Winnipeg during late 1990 and their impact on upper and lower trophic levels is unclear. To begin to understand the impact of this invasive species in this large, shallow lake, dietary composition of smelt was described. During mid-summer 2008 and 2009, we simultaneously quantified the stomach contents of smelt and characterized the zooplankton community in the North Basin of Lake Winnipeg. Zooplankton and rainbow smelt (total length: 70-130. mm) were collected from ten stations in 2008 and six in 2009 on the M.V. Namao. The relative abundance of four zooplankton prey types (copepods, Daphnia spp., Eubosmina coregoni and Bosmina longirostris) was determined from the zooplankton samples and the smelt stomach contents. Using electivity indices, we found that rainbow smelt preferred Daphnia spp., as well as larger individuals of Daphnia spp., in both years. Preference for larger Daphnia spp. is likely due to conspicuousness (size, movement patterns) and slow swimming speeds relative to the other prey types. With detailed knowledge of the trophic linkage between rainbow smelt and the zooplankton community, we can begin to quantify the effects of invasive rainbow smelt on the food web structure of the lake. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The spatial variation in shelter availability and density of salmonids was quantified prior to the release. We found no effect of released fish number on the number of marked salmon moving more than 12.5–112.5 m away from their release site. However, the ratio of pre-experiment fish density per shelter was positively related to the number of movers. Thus, fish that were released at sites where the amount of shelter was low relative to the density of the pre-experiment population were more likely to move. These results support the prediction from smaller scale experimental studies that shelter availability may act to determine local carrying capacity in stream-living salmonid populations.},

Pure availability predicted diet best and provided, in most cases, a significant fit with the observed diet. In a quantitative literature review, the mean proportion of terrestrial prey in salmonid diets was 17\%, being highest for the largest fish (≥15 cm).

	abstract = {We developed and tested a combined foraging and bioenergetics model for predicting growth over the lifetime of drift-feeding brown trout. The foraging component estimates gross energy intake within a fish- and prey size-dependent semicircular foraging area that is perpendicular to the flow, with options for fish feeding across velocity differentials. The bioenergetics component predicts how energy is allocated to growth, reproduction, foraging costs,nd basal metabolism. The model can reveal the degree to which growth is limited by the density and size structure of invertebrate drift within the physiological constraints set by water temperature. We tested the model by predicting growth based on water temperature and on drift density and size structure data from postemergence to age 12, and we compared the predictions with observed size at age as determined from otoliths and scales for a New Zealand river brown trout population. The model produced realistically shaped growth curves in relation to the observed data, accurately predicting mean size at age over the lifetime of the trout, assuming 24-h maximum rations and including diurnal drift-foraging costs (predicted versus observed weight r(2) = 0.94; length r(2) = 0.97). The model predicted that, within a given water-temperature regime, growth is limited primarily by reproduction costs but also by increasing foraging costs as trout grow (a phenomenon that is associated with the increasing foraging time that is required in order to feed to satiation on small invertebrate drift prey). Invertebrate drift size structure significantly influenced predicted growth, especially maximum size, through its effect on foraging time. The model has potential in terms of the exploration of growth-limiting factors and has associated use as an environmental-impact tool and as an aid for hypothesis generation in studies of salmonid growth processes.},

	abstract = {Abstract: When animals are faced with extraordinary energy-consuming events, like hibernation, finding abundant, energy-rich food resources becomes particularly important. The profitability of food resources can vary spatially, depending on occurrence, quality, and local abundance. Here, we used the brown bear (Ursus arctos) as a model species to quantify selective foraging on berries in different habitats during hyperphagia in autumn prior to hibernation. During the peak berry season in August and September, we sampled berry occurrence, abundance, and sugar content, a proxy for quality, at locations selected by bears for foraging and at random locations in the landscape. The factors determining selection of berries were species specific across the different habitats. Compared to random locations, bears selected locations with a higher probability of occurrence and higher abundance of bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) and a higher probability of occurrence, but not abundance, of lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Crowberries (Empetrum hermaphroditum) were least available and least used. Sugar content affected the selection of lingonberries, but not of bilberries. Abundance of bilberries at random locations decreased and abundance of lingonberries increased during fall, but bears did not adjust their foraging strategy by increasing selection for lingonberries. Forestry practices had a large effect on berry occurrence and abundance, and brown bears responded by foraging most selectively in mature forests and on clearcuts. This study shows that bears are successful in navigating human-shaped forest landscapes by using areas of higher than average berry abundance in a period when abundant food intake is particularly important to increase body mass prior to hibernation. Significance statement: Food resources heterogeneity, caused by spatial and temporal variation of specific foods, poses a challenge to foragers, particularly when faced with extraordinary energy-demanding events, like hibernation. Brown bears in Sweden inhabit a landscape shaped by forestry practices. Bilberries and lingonberries, the bears’ main food resources in autumn prior to hibernation, show different temporal and habitat-specific ripening patterns. We quantified the bears’ selective foraging on these berry species on clearcuts, bogs, young, and mature forests compared to random locations. Despite a temporal decline of ripe bilberries, bears used locations with a greater occurrence and abundance of bilberries, but not lingonberries. We conclude that bears successfully navigated in this heavily human-shaped landscape by selectively foraging in high-return habitats for bilberries, but did not compensate for the decline in bilberries by eating more lingonberries.},

We estimated survival and movement while testing for effects of stream reach and time using a multistrata Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in Program {MARK}. Multistrata models were analysed for three age groups (age-0, age-1 and age-2+) to estimate apparent survival, capture probability and movement. Survival varied by time period, but not brown trout abundance and was lower during flood events. Age-0 brook trout emigrated from reaches with low brown trout abundance, whereas adult brook trout emigrated from downstream brown trout-dominated reaches. Growth was highest in spring and summer and did not differ across streams or reaches for the youngest age classes. For age-2+ brook trout, however, growth was lower in reaches where brown trout were abundant. Interspecific interactions can be age or size dependent; our results show evidence for adult interactions, but not for age-0. Our results suggest that brook trout can be limited by both environmental and brown trout interactions that can vary by season and life stage. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.},

	abstract = {Foraging methods are highly variable, but can be grouped into two modes: searching and ambush. While research has focused on the functioning of each mode, the question of how animals choose which to use has been largely neglected. Here we consider a forager that exploits prey that are patchily distributed in space and time. This forager can either sit and wait for prey to appear or search for prey, which is more likely to result in encounters with prey but costs more energy and/or exposes the forager to greater predation risk. The currency that natural selection appears to have optimized will be determined by the additional costs of searching and whether there is a risk of starvation. We therefore compare the predictions of models based on currencies that consider only energy and predation risk to state-dependent models in which energy reserves are used to trade off predation rate, starvation rate and investment in growth. The choice of currency qualitatively affects how mode should change when prey abundance and prey patchiness increase. We show how differing prey distributions can explain variation in effects of experimentally increasing prey abundance. Our work has several implications for the study of foraging mode, population dynamics and the methods used to assess population size.},

	abstract = {Salmon and trout have been introduced to many ecosystems worldwide, yet the ecological impacts of salmonid introductions remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of introduced Pacific salmon on stream-resident fish in the Great Lakes basin by monitoring the movements of passive integrative transponder ({PIT})-tagged brook trout in a Lake Michigan tributary receiving a salmon spawning run and in a nearby stream not receiving salmon. Coincident with the September arrival of salmon, an estimated 52\% of resident brook trout moved {\textgreater}200m, while no such movements were detected in the nonsalmon stream. After 3-4days, however, brook trout movement patterns became similar in the two streams, suggesting that salmon effects on brook trout movements were short-lived. Movements in the salmon stream were predominantly upstream in direction, with 50\% of the tagged brook trout travelling from below to above the stationary {PIT} tag readers during the study. Declining water temperatures with the onset of fall coincided with low levels of brook trout movement at both sites, likely due to relocation for spawning. Increased brook trout movements coincident with the arrival of salmon spawners could be driven by a combination of interference competition and egg consumption. Using a bioenergetics model, we estimated that the energy lost to movement was likely compensated by the energy obtained from consuming salmon eggs. We conclude that salmon spawners can substantially increase brook trout movement, but in our study, these effects were short-lived and likely negligible from a bioenergetics perspective. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons A/S.},

Many fishes use these resources but the relationship between fish body size and the reliance on salmon-derived nutrients might follow one of several patterns related to the onset of egg consumption with body size as fish grow, and possible shifts to alternative prey such as fishes as they grow larger still. In this study, these size-dependent hypotheses of marine subsidy use by resident Dolly Varden, Salvelinus malma, were tested using diet and stable isotope analyses. S. malma did not shift abruptly to a reliance on salmon eggs after they became large enough to eat eggs (i.e., no gape limitation). Rather, fish large enough to eat eggs but {\textless} 150 mm showed diets that blended salmon nutrients with aquatic insects, likely because they were spatially segregated from the highest concentration of spawning sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka. From intermediate through the largest sizes observed (150 to {\textgreater} 600 mm long) S. malma received ca. 80 \% of their nutrients from salmon (eggs, flesh, and maggots that had scavenged dead salmon) based on diet analysis and stable isotope ratios despite being large enough to consume fish, as many similarly-sized salmonids do in other ecosystems. The few fish sampled in June, prior to the availability of salmon subsidies, had stable isotope signatures that also reflected heavy (ca. 90 \%) reliance on marine sources, likely because they had eaten little since the end of the salmon run the previous fall. This apparent avoidance of piscivory in favor a rich yet pulsed marine subsidy highlights the importance of healthy salmon runs for the sake of not only the salmon but resident fishes that consume them.},

We compared (1) drying the whole fish and homogenizing the dried fish tissue, (2) homogenization prior to drying and then drying the subsample of fish tissue, and (3) homogenization after autoclaving to soften the hard structures and then drying a subsample of the homogenized fish tissue. Sample drying time and energy density estimates were compared among techniques across a size range (wet mass = 32-1,080 g) of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. Both of the subsampling techniques reduced drying time by about 40\% relative to drying the whole fish. All three methods provided statistically similar estimates of largemouth bass energy densities. The autoclave process was most efficient, minimizing both sample preparation time and drying time. Variance of energy density estimates was greater for both subsampling methods compared with the traditional whole-fish method. Thus, subsampling can decrease sample preparation time for bomb calorimetry but may reduce power to detect differences among variables of interest (e.g., season). Lastly, estimates of energy density for largemouth bass were a function of body mass, suggesting that using a constant energy density in bioenergetics models is not appropriate. © American Fisheries Society 2010.},

	abstract = {The extent to which environmental context mediates the bioaccumulation of biotransported contaminants by stream-resident organisms is poorly understood. For example, it is unclear the extent to which contaminant type, instream characteristics or resident fish identity interact to influence the uptake of contaminants deposited by Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) during their spawning runs. To address this uncertainty, we sampled four stream-resident fish species from 13 watersheds of the Laurentian Great Lakes in locations with and without salmon runs across a gradient of instream and watershed characteristics. We determined the polychlorinated biphenyl ({PCB}) and mercury (Hg) concentration along with the stable isotope ratios for salmon and stream-resident fish. We found that stream-resident fish {PCB} concentrations were higher in reaches with salmon and were positively related to δ15N. In contrast, resident fish Hg concentrations were similar or lower in reaches with salmon compared with reaches lacking salmon and either exhibited a negative or no relationship with δ15N. Based on {AICc}, resident fish exhibited species-specific {PCB} concentrations that were positively related to salmon {PCB} flux. Hg burdens exhibited an interaction between fish length and salmon Hg flux—as salmon Hg inputs increased, Hg levels decreased with increasing resident fish length. Because salmon eggs are enriched in {PCBs} but depleted in Hg, contaminant loads of resident fish appear to be driven by consumption of salmon eggs. We found no support for models that included the mediating influence of instream or watershed factors. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight that contaminants bioaccumulate differently depending on contaminant type, species identity and the trophic pathway to contamination. Consequently, consideration of the recipient food web and route of exposure is critical to understanding the fate of biotransported contaminants in ecosystems. The transfer of contaminants by migratory organisms represents an understudied stressor in ecology. Effective management of biotransported contaminants will require the delineation of hotspots of biotransport and implementation of best management practices to reduce inputs of salmon-derived pollutants.},

	abstract = {Fisheries models generally are based on the concept that strong density dependence exists in fish populations. Nonetheless, there are few examples of long-term density dependence in fish populations. Using an information theoretical approach ({AIC}) with regression analyses, we examined the explanatory power of density dependence, flow and water temperature on the per capita rate of change and growth (annual mean total length) for the whole population, adults, 1+ and young-of-the-year ({YOY}) brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Hunt Creek, Michigan, {USA}, between 1951 and 2001. This time series represents one of the longest quantitative population data sets for fishes. Our analysis included four data sets: (i) Pooled (1951-2001), (ii) Fished (1951-65), (iii) Unfished (1966-2001) and (iv) Temperature (1982-2001). Principle component analyses of winter flow data identified a gradient between years with high mean daily winter flows, high daily maximum and minimum flows and frequent high flow events, and years with an opposite set of flow characteristics. Flows were lower during the Fished Period than during the Unfished Period. Winter temperature analyses elucidated a gradient between warm mean, warm minimum and maximum daily stream temperatures and a high number of minimum daily temperatures {\textgreater}6.1°C, and years with the opposite characteristics. Summer temperature analyses contrasted years with warm summer stream temperatures vs years with cool summer stream temperatures. Both {YOY} and adult densities varied several-fold during the study. Regression analysis did not detect a significant linear or nonlinear stock-recruitment relationship. {AIC} analysis indicated that density dependence was present in 15 of 16 cases (four population segments×four data sets) for both per capita rate of increase (w i values 0.46-1.00) and growth data (w i values 0.28-0.99). The almost ubiquitous presence of density dependence in both population and growth data is concordant with results from other trout populations and other studies in Michigan. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Feeding frequencies were from one meal every second day to six meals per day, within the range common to current piscicultural techniques. Fish were fed a dry, pelleted diet either to satiation at each meal, or in restricted total daily amounts based on a percentage of their wet body weight. All fish were forced to swim at a constant speed of approximately one body length per second to minimize variability in growth and body composition. Maximum daily food intake occurred with just two feedings to satiation per day. Growth closely paralleled food intake. Neither specific growth rate nor whole body levels of moisture, lipid or protein were affected significantly by differences in feeding frequency. A trend towards increased body fat with more frequent feeding was observed among fish fed to satiation at each meal; this was believed to be the result of a somewhat higher total food intake than among less frequently fed fish. Fish fed a restricted daily ration divided into a number of meals exhibited smaller differences in lipid content. The general lack of response to feeding frequency was attributed primarily to the low metabolic rate of trout and to the characteristically slow rate of food passage in the digestive tract. © 1977.},

In many Great Lakes tributaries, steelhead spawning and nursery habitats are limited by hydropower dams, and natural recruitment may be supplemented by habitats in adjacent coldwater creeks. In 1998-2001, we investigated the potential for natural production of steelhead in the Muskegon River, Michigan, a tributary to Lake Michigan, through analysis of parr diet categories, consumption, growth, survival, and production in the main-stem Muskegon River and in Bigelow Creek. We used electrofishing surveys to estimate Parr growth and survival from changes in fish weight and density over time. We estimated diet from gut content analysis and consumption from bioenergetics model analysis. Average fall density of part in Bigelow Creek was 20-fold higher than in the Muskegon River. Average summer daily mortality rate of Parr in the Muskegon River was nearly threefold higher than in Bigelow Creek. Overwinter mortality rates of Parr were low in both habitats. Few yearling and older parr were present in the Muskegon River relative to Bigelow Creek. Age-0 Parr primarily consumed benthic invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate prey densities were sufficient to support high parr growth rates in both rivers. Parr grew at similar rates but consumed 84\% more per day in the Muskegon River, which had higher water temperatures than Bigelow Creek. Age-0 production was fivefold higher in Bigelow Creek than in the Muskegon River. High mortalities of parr in the Muskegon River were correlated with summer water temperatures exceeding 21 degrees C. Average summer temperatures in Bigelow Creek (17 degrees C) were optimal for Parr survival. Our results were consistent with data from other Great Lakes tributaries and suggest that small tributary creek habitats contribute disproportionately to steelhead recruitment from large impounded watersheds by providing optimal thermal refugia for Parr during summer.},

study objectives were to measure seasonal changes in percent dry weight and energy density (physiological-based
measures of condition) of stream-dwelling Appalachian Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, field-validate bioelectrical
impedance analysis ({BIA}) models, and compare reliability of {BIA} and morphometric-based estimates of condition.
Percent dry weight was highly correlated to energy density (R2 = 0.93; J/g wet weight = −1,803.5 + 286.43 ∙ [percent dry
weight]), and the relationship was clearly different from those published previously for other salmonids. Significant
seasonal changes in adult Brook Trout condition were observed and likely related to energy depletion from reproduction
and changes in terrestrial invertebrate consumption. Adult percent dry weight peaked in early September and was
lowest in February. Age-0 fish did not have large changes in measured condition between summer and winter.
Bioelectrical impedance analysis was able to estimate adult mean monthly percent dry weight reliably; however, it
did not appear to outperform results from relative weight (Wr). Neither Wr nor predicted percent dry weight from {BIA}
was a reliable estimator of condition for individual adult fish. The {BIA} model for age-0 fish was unable to provide
reliable predictions for either individual fish or monthly mean estimates, due in large part to the small range in
measured condition. The {BIA} estimated monthly mean energy density more reliably than {didWr}. Overall results of this
study indicate that {BIA} did not performappreciably better than Wr, which requiredmuch less effort to collect. Potential
{BIA} model improvements may be possible by accounting for changes in skin temperature. Until improvements in the
Brook Trout {BIA} models occur, their use should be limited to estimating mean energy density.},

	abstract = {Several empirical studies suggest that herbivores may promote coexistence between plants by relaxing the strength of resource competition. In contrast, recent mathematical models predict that food-limited herbivory instead cause exclusion through apparent competition, regardless of whether herbivore selectivity is constant or density dependent. This study extends existing theory to consider a strongly seasonal system. Herbivores with fixed diet preferences have the same effect regardless of seasonality, but there is a marked difference when the diet selectivity of herbivores conforms to a simple optimal-foraging model. An optimally foraging herbivore in a seasonal environment is able to promote plant coexistence among many species. The mechanism involves diet switching, occurring over narrow density intervals. For this to have an effect in a nonseasonal model, equilibrium resource densities must be in this interval, which requires close parameter fitting. In seasonal environments, resource densities change through the year and may frequently move across narrow regions in which diet changes occur. The potential of gray-sided voles to promote coexistence between two arctic dwarf shrubs is evaluated in terms of the model. For this system, it is shown that vole herbivory has the potential to reverse competitive dominance. © 1998 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Climate change is likely to increase the metabolisms of ectothermic animals living below their thermal optimum. While ectothermic top predators may compensate by increasing foraging, ectothermic prey may be unable to increase foraging because of increased predation risk from ectothermic predators. We examined how the diurnal drift behavior (i.e., the downstream movement associated with foraging) of the mayfly Baetis, an ectothermic herbivore, responds to changing temperature in the implied presence and absence of trout, an ectothermic predator. In an experiment replicated at the catchment scale, water temperature and trout presence strongly interacted to affect the diurnal drift of Baetis from artificial channels lacking periphyton over a water temperature range of 4.2-14.8 °C. In fishless streams, daytime drift increased with increasing water temperature, likely because of increased metabolic demand for food. However, in trout-bearing streams, daytime drift decreased with increasing water temperature. Our interpretation is that the perceived threat of trout rose with increasing water temperature, causing mayflies to reduce foraging despite heightened metabolic demand. These results suggest that anticipated increases in stream temperature due to climate change may further escalate divergence in structure and process between fishless and trout-bearing streams. Similar dynamics may occur in other ecosystems with ectothermic predators and prey living below their thermal optima. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

that predict energy density (J/g wet weight) from fish percent dry weight. Data were gathered from
the literature, obtained from cooperating investigators, and measured directly. Least-squares models
were derived for all species combined and for orders, families, and species. All models were linear;
however, logarithmic transformation was necessary to normalize residuals in the combined model.
All models with more than four data points were highly significant (P {\textless} 0.002) and had coefficients
of determination of 0.76 or greater. The model for all species combined (N = 587, r2 = 0.95)
was J/g wet weight = 45.29 {DW}1-507; {DW} is the percent dry weight of the fish. At all taxonomic
levels, energy density models showed a strong positive relationship between energy density and

	abstract = {Living in an aquatic environment, often devoid of light but rich in dissolved compounds, fish have highly developed chemosensory and chemical signalling systems. The olfactory and gustatory systems comprise the major chemosensory pathways. Despite considerable variations in structural organization of the peripheral olfactory organ throughout fish species, ultrastructural organization of the olfactory sensory epithelium is extremely consistent. The olfactory receptor cell is a bipolar neurone which is directly exposed to the external environment and sends information to the brain by its own axon (cranial nerve I). Four major classes of chemicals have been identified as specific olfactory stimuli and their stimulatory effectiveness characterized: amino acids, sex steroids, bile acids/salts and prostaglandins. Olfactory signals such as those involved in reproduction and feeding may be processed independently through two distinct subsystems: the lateral and medial olfactory systems. The taste buds constitute the structural basis of the gustatory organ. Taste buds may occur not only in the oropharyngeal cavity, but on the whole body surface. Chemical information detected by specialized epithelial cells, gustatory cells, is transmitted to the central nervous system by cranial nerve {VII} (facial), {IX} (glossopharyngeal), and X (vagal). Besides diverse sensitivities and specificities for amino acids, fish gustatory receptors detect various organic acids, nucleotides and bile salts. Putative receptors, molecular mechanisms of transduction and the role played by olfaction and gustation in feeding, reproduction, migration and other fish behaviours are discussed. © 1994 Scandinavian Physiological Society},

Bioenergetics models have been applied lo a variety of research and management questions relating to fish stocks, populations, food webs, and ecosystems. Applications include estimates of the intensity and dynamics of predator-prey interactions, nutrient cycling within aquatic food webs of varying trophic structure, and food requirements of single animals, whole populations, and communities of fishes. As tools in food web and ecosystem applications, bioenergetics models have been used to compare forage consumption by salmonid predators across the Laurentian Great Lakes for single populations and whole communities, and to estimate the growth potential of pelagic predators in Chesapeake Bay and Lake Ontario. Some critics say that bioenergetics models lack sufficient detail to produce reliable results in such field applications, whereas others say that the models are too complex to be useful tools for fishery managers. Nevertheless, bioenergetics models have achieved notable predictive successes. Improved estimates are needed for model parameters such as metabolic costs of activity, and more complete studies are needed of the bioenergetics of larval and juvenile fishes. Future research on bioenergetics should include laboratory and field measurements of key model parameters such as weight-dependent maximum consumption, respiration and activity, and thermal habitats actually occupied by fish. Future applications of bioenergetics models to fish populations also depend on accurate estimates of population sizes and survival rates. © by the American Fisheries Society 1993.},

Feeding lasted for a period of 20 weeks. High growth rates were obtained, and fish were able to maintain growth in all groups by increasing feed intake when plant proteins exerted high amounts of the protein fraction. This was confirmed by increased feed conversion ratio ({FCR}) values. The apparent digestibility measured by means of faecal stripping, showed high apparent digestibility coefficients ({ADC}) for fat, starch and protein. Small decreases in protein {ADC} and larger decreases in fat {ADC} were observed with high levels of plant protein ingredients. No histopathological changes were found, neither in liver nor in the different sections of the gastrointestinal ({GI}) tract, for any of the diet groups. Expression of stress genes (heat shock protein 70 and 90 ({HSP}70 and {HSP}90)) in liver showed no response to high levels of plant protein. Invasion of gut-bacteria in the distal part of the {GI} tract was substantial, but independent of diet level of plant ingredients. Gut evacuation analysis showed that the time for a meal to pass through the stomach and the {GI} tract was more than 72 h, with no variation dependent on diet plant protein level. The major conclusion is that cod shows a high tolerance to the plant protein sources investigated in this experiment, and consequently that Atlantic cod safely can be fed diets holding up to 440 g kg-1 of the present investigated plant protein ingredients without any adverse effects on intestinal or liver function.

In order to elucidate endocrine interactions and links to regulation of growth, adiposity and energy metabolism, plasma levels of {GH}, insulin-like growth factor I ({IGF}-I), leptin (Lep) and ghrelin, were assessed and correlated to growth and energy status. In addition tissue-specific expression of lepa1 {mRNA} was examined. Juvenile rainbow trout were implanted with sustained-release bovine {GH} implants and terminally sub-sampled at 1, 3 and 6. weeks. {GH} increased specific growth rate, reduced condition factor ({CF}) and increased feed conversion efficiency resulting in a redistribution of energy stores. Thus, {GH} decreased mesenteric ({MSI}) and liver somatic index ({LSI}). Lipid content of the belly flap increased following {GH}-treatment while liver and muscle lipid content decreased. Independent of {GH} substantial growth was accompanied by an increase in muscle lipids and a decrease in belly flap lipids. The data suggest that the belly flap may function as an energy buffering tissue during episodes of feeding and lean growth. Liver and muscle lipids were positively correlated to body weight, indicating a size-dependent change in adiposity. Hepatic lepa1 {mRNA} positively correlated to {MSI} and {CF} and its expression decreased following {GH} treatment, coinciding with decreased hepatic lipid content. Plasma Lep was positively correlated to {MSI} and belly flap lipid content, suggesting that Lep may communicate energy status.

	abstract = {We tracked six individuals of three shark species, the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, great white, Carcharodon carcharias, and blue, Prionace glauca, near the submarine canyon off La Jolla, southern California during the summers of 1995 and 1997. The duration of tracking ranged from 2 to 38 h per shark. The mode of travel differed in one respect among species. The rate of movement of the endothermic species, the mako and white shark, exceeded that of the ectothermic species, the blue shark. Similarities among species were more common. Firstly, individuals of all three species swam in a directional manner. Secondly, individuals constantly moved up and down in the water column, exhibiting oscillatory or yo-yo swimming. Thirdly, members of the three species swam at the surface for prolonged periods. Finally, the movements of the mako and white sharks were at times loosely associated with bottom topography. We discuss the various adaptive advantages that have been proposed for these behavioral patterns. Oscillatory swimming has been attributed to the following: (1) heating the body in the warm surface waters after swimming in cold, deep water, (2) alternating between two strata of water, one carrying chemical information as to its source, and deriving a direction to that stratum's origin, (3) conserving energy by quickly propelling oneself upward with many tail beats and slowly gliding downward with few beats, and (4) descending to where magnetic gradients are steeper, more perceptible, and useful to guide migratory movements. At the surface, an individual would be able to swim in a straight line by using following features as a reference: (1) celestial bodies, (2) polarized light, or (3) the earth's main dipole field. Furthermore, an individual would conserve energy because of the greater ease to maintaining a warm body in the heated surface waters.},

	abstract = {Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are found throughout Lake Superior, Lake Nipigon, and their tributaries. Lacustrine and adfluvial life history variants were historically popular with anglers and were called coasters; coaster brook trout populations are now severely reduced and are of conservation concern. Coasters were known to grow larger and mature later than their stream resident counterparts. This study compared movement patterns, age, size, condition, and relative weight of wild coaster and resident brook trout from the Hurricane River, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, Michigan. Wild brook trout ≥ 100 mm from the Hurricane River downstream from Hurricane Falls were tagged with passive integrated transponder tags and monitored for stream-lake movement behavior from May 2003 to November 2007. During 2006 and 2007, brook trout were scale sampled and aged to construct a regression that was then used to calculate the age of all brook trout tagged from 2003 to 2007. Most brook trout movement took place in the fall with October the peak month of emigration with a secondary peak in late spring/early summer and some activity nearly year round. There were no differences found in age structure, size or condition between coasters and residents while in the stream. Our data suggest that a priori growth differences are not determining the expression of coaster outmigration and that stream-lake movements made by coasters, likely driven by habitat requirements, may be highly flexible and facultative. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Non-native brook trout have become widely established in North European streams. We combined evidence from an artificial-stream experiment and drainage-scale field surveys to examine whether brook trout suppressed the growth of the native brown trout (age 0 to age 2). Our experimental results demonstrated that brown trout were unaffected by the presence of brook trout but that brook trout showed reduced growth in the presence of brown trout. However, the growth reduction only appeared in the experimental setting, indicating that the reduced spatial constraint of the experimental system may have forced the fish to unnaturally intense interactions. Indeed, in the field, no effect of either species on the growth of the putative competitor was detected. These results caution against uncritical acceptance of findings from small-scale experiments because they rarely scale up to more complex field situations. This and earlier work suggest that the establishment of brook trout in North European streams has taken place mainly because of the availability of unoccupied (or underutilized) niche space, rather than as a result of species trait combinations or interspecific competition per se. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

Fish (average weight, 11.1 ± 0.4 g) were randomly distributed in thirty-six 300 L tanks in a flowthrough system. Triplicate groups (30 fish per tank) of fish were fed each feed type to visual satiation at three meals per day, two meals per day, one meal per day and one meal every 2 days for 7 weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, the survival of fish was not significantly different among the treatments. Weight gain was affected by the feeding frequency. The highest weight gain was observed in fish fed the {EP} at three meals per day. The daily feed intake of fish fed the {MP} and {DP} tended to be higher than that of fish fed the {EP} at each feeding frequency. The feed efficiency and the protein efficiency ratio of fish fed the {EP} were higher than those of fish fed the {MP} and {DP}. The body proximate composition of fish was altered by the feeding frequency. The crude lipid content increased with the increase in the feeding frequency.

	abstract = {Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) restoration efforts in Lake Ontario have resulted in an abundance of spawning fish of hatchery-origin but virtually no detectable natural recruitment. One explanation has been predation by non-native alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) on lake trout fry. The purpose of this study was to determine if alewives could be important predators on lake trout fry. In the laboratory, fry behavior was examined to ascertain when fry would be present in the water column during a 24-hour period and to determine the acceptability of fry as food for alewives. In aquaria exposed to ambient light regimes, sac fry activity in the water column was much greater at night than during day-light hours (P {\textless} 0.001). In laboratory tanks, lake trout fry (15-34 mm) were aggressively eaten by alewives (118-175 mm). Field studies were conducted at Stony Island Reef, Lake Ontario in 1989-1993 to determine whether alewives and fry were present at the same time on the reef, if alewives fed when on the reef, and if alewives fed upon naturally-produced lake trout fry. Lake trout fry captured in traps indicated that sac and emergent fry were available as prey from the middle of April through the third week of May. The first capture of alewives in gillnets set adjacent to the fry traps was typically in early May and corresponded to the peak capture of sac fry in traps. Food was present in 86\% of the 1,239 alewives captured after sunset over the 5-year period. Ten lake trout fry were found in 6 of the 62 alewives captured after sunset on 20 May 1993 at Stony Island Reef; no fry were found in alewife stomachs caught on other dates. Predation by alewives might have caused substantial mortality of lake trout fry from spawning areas in Lake Ontario where alewives were abundant and could also be an important source of mortality in similar areas of Lakes Michigan and Huron. Increased stocking of predatory salmonids to suppress the alewife could enhance survival of fry and speed restoration in Lake Ontario, but suppression seems unlikely under current strategies to manage the alewife as forage for non-native salmonids. In this context, lakewide goals should be re-focused on restoration in localized areas where alewives do not congregate during the spring and predation on lake trout fry would be minimal—such as at offshore shoals. © 1995, International Association for Great Lakes Research.

The {PCB} concentrations were also determined in alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), bloater (Coregonus hoyi), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), and deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsoni), five species of prey fish eaten by lake trout in Lake Michigan, at three nearshore sites in the lake. Despite the lack of significant differences in the {PCB} concentrations of alewife, rainbow smelt, bloater, slimy sculpin, and deepwater sculpin from the southeastern nearshore site near Saugatuck (Michigan) compared with the corresponding {PCB} concentrations from the northwestern nearshore site near Sturgeon Bay (Wisconsin), {PCB} concentrations in lake trout at Saugatuck were significantly higher than those at Sturgeon Bay. The difference in the lake trout {PCB} concentrations between Saugatuck and Sturgeon Bay could be explained by diet differences. The diet of lake trout at Saugatuck was more concentrated in {PCBs} than the diet of Sturgeon Bay lake trout, and therefore lake trout at Saugatuck were more contaminated in {PCBs} than Sturgeon Bay lake trout. These findings were useful in interpreting the long-term monitoring series for contaminants in lake trout at both Saugatuck and the Wisconsin side of the lake.},

	abstract = {I used a bioenergetics model to test whether overwinter starvation of age-0 smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, a representative warmwater species, could account for their scarcity in coldwater streams of Wisconsin. I modeled 84 combinations of food consumption rate, maximum daily mean summer temperature, and winter duration that encompassed the range of conditions likely to be encountered in Wisconsin streams, and ran simulations for the specific thermal regimes in four coldwater, one coolwater, and two warmwater Wisconsin streams where smallmouth bass population status was known. The model predicted that starvation mortality was unlikely at the highest food consumption rates, the warmest summer temperatures, and the shortest winters. Mortality increased with decreasing food consumption rates, decreasing maximum summer temperatures, and increasing winter duration. Starvation mortality was predicted to be negligible in the two Wisconsin warmwater streams, which had self-sustaining smallmouth bass populations, and to be generally minor in the coolwater and three of the four coldwater streams, all of which lacked smallmouth bass. Only in the coldwater stream with the lowest maximum summer temperature and longest winter, a stream that also lacked smallmouth bass, was mean starvation mortality predicted to consistently exceed 30\%. I conclude that, by itself, overwinter starvation of age-0 smallmouth bass is unlikely to limit the occurrence of smallmouth bass in most Wisconsin's coldwater streams. The model also predicted relatively slow growth of age-0 smallmouth bass in Wisconsin coldwater streams. Reduced growth could make age-0 smallmouth bass susceptible to other sources of mortality (e.g., predation, displacement) and might contribute to their scarcity in coldwater streams.},

Our aim was to test whether the fish gut content from biological collections can be used for comparisons with current data and, consequently, be used as a tool for long-term environmental impact studies. We compared the gut content of fish preserved for fifteen years in a biological collection with recently sampled fish, considering the factors size of the specimen, preservation time and preservation form. We did not find differences in the gut content percentage of preservation between fish size classes and preservation time. However, we found differences between preservation form, in which the fish fixed in formalin kept the digestive content preserved while the fish preserved directly in alcohol did not. Thus, we encourage the use of fish gut content from biological collections fixed in formalin for long-term ecological studies. Our findings may help elucidate some long-term effects of human impacts on fish fauna.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1439-0310.2004.01052.x},
	abstract = {An understanding of animal time budgets is crucial to behavioural biology. Although many studies have analysed time budgets of individual species, only a few have made interspecific comparisons. Here we take an interspecific look at one part of the time budget, feeding time. We hypothesize that feeding time can be predicted by the amount of time an animal needs to reach satiation. This time should be equal to the ratio of handling time to digestion time. For 19 herbivorous species from insects to mammals, we calculate this ratio and compare it to the observed feeding time. The mean difference between calculated and observed values is small (a half hour per 24 h-day), indicating that herbivore feeding times can often be approximated by the ratio of handling time to digestion time. We make three points concerning the time allocated to feeding in herbivores based on this interspecific comparison. First, our analysis suggests that herbivores often feed to satiation, which could mean that they are often released from time constraints. It is also possible, however, that while herbivores have enough time to reach satiation, they do not necessarily have sufficient time to choose the most desirable diet. Wilson's principle of stringency theoretically supports the former interpretation. It suggests that animals experience periods in their life in which they are time-constrained but that these periods are the exception rather than the rule. Most optimal foraging studies have assumed the opposite. The second point of this paper is therefore a recommendation: to consider the possibility that animals may often be released from time constraints. The third and final point is that feeding time is independent of body mass in our analysis. This is because handling time scales with body mass according to a parameter that is similar to the one for digestion time, and feeding time can be approximated by the ratio of handling time to digestion time.},

Focusing on carnivores, I provide evidence for the latter scenario. I develop a model that predicts the minimum food abundance at which a carnivore reaches satiation and is released from time constraints. Literature data from five invertebrate and vertebrate species suggest that food abundances experienced in the field often exceed this threshold. A comparison of energetic demands to kill rates also suggests that carnivores often reach satiation: for the 16 bird and mammal species analyzed, this frequency is 88\% (average across species). Because pressure of time would likely lead to trade-offs in time allocation and thus to a nonsatiating food consumption, these results suggest that carnivores are often released from time constraints. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {We describe a novel, weight of evidence-based approach for selecting fish community metrics to assess estuarine health, and its application in selecting metrics for a multi-metric health index for the Swan Estuary, Western Australia. In the absence of reliable, independent measures of estuarine condition against which to test the sensitivity of candidate metrics, objective, multivariate statistical analyses and multi-model inference were employed to select metric subsets likely to be most sensitive to inter-annual changes in the health of this ecosystem. Novel pre-treatment techniques were first applied to down-weight the influence of highly erratic metrics and to minimise the effects of seasonal and spatial differences in sampling upon metric variability. A weight of evidence approach was then adopted to select those metrics which responded most consistently across multiple analyses of nearshore and offshore fish abundance data sets collected between 1976 and 2009. Sets of 11 and seven metrics were selected for assessing the health of the nearshore and offshore waters of the Swan Estuary, respectively. Selected metrics represented species composition and diversity, trophic structure, life history and habitat functions and, in the case of the nearshore index, a potential sentinel species. These metric sets are currently being used to construct a multi-metric health index for the Swan Estuary, which is the first such tool to be developed for assessing the health of estuaries in Australia. More broadly, while the methodology has in the present case been applied to the fish fauna of the Swan Estuary, it is generally applicable to any ecosystem and type of biotic community from which an ecosystem health index might be sensibly derived. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) are increasingly being used as indicator species. This has primarily entailed measuring their condition, the assumption being that condition can be used as a surrogate for lipid content. While there is evidence to suggest this assumption is applicable to some fish, it has yet to be validated for C. cognatus. Further, there are several means by which one may calculate condition, the most commonly employed of which are indirect measurements of lipid content (namely, Fulton's K, somatic K (Ks), and Le Cren's relative condition factor (Kn)). We compared the ability of each of these morphometric indices to predict whole-body lipid content in C. cognatus. There was a moderate degree of evidence that Fulton's K, Ks, and Kn are reliable predictors (Ks and Kn in particular). Of the latter we recommend Kn be used because, unlike Ks, it does not require that fish be killed. And while Fulton's K did not perform quite as well, we consider it a sufficient substitute if the data necessary to calculate Kn are unavailable.},

	abstract = {A method for studying animal movements based on data from independent data-logging acoustic receivers is described. The method takes presence or absence data from multiple receivers arranged in an array and converts them to position estimates based on weighted means of the number of signal receptions at each receiver during a specified time period. The method is equivalent to a short-term center of activity rather than a precise estimate of location at a single time. The utility of the method was assessed using data from a study of neonate blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Periods between 5 and 60 min were tested to find the most appropriate interval for estimating positions. The results from the method agreed closely with a simulated shark track and data from actively tracked sharks. The median distances between successive locations from the mean-position algorithm were between 28\% and 42\% of those from active tracking because of the center-of-activity nature of the method. The results presented demonstrate that the technique provides a useful method for investigating long-term movement patterns, space utilization patterns over broader areas, and home range.},

	abstract = {To evaluate interstock differences in condition, it would be advantageous to develop stock-level condition indices from standardized databases on weight and length. This study describes a method for estimating stock-level condition when individual-level observations on length and weight are not easily accessible. For each year in a 56-year time series (1946-2001) for Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua), pseudo-observations of weight and length were generated by pairing the Norwegian and Russian values for weight-at-age provided annually to the assessment working group with estimates of length-at-age derived from the same databases. A weight-length relationship fit to each year was then used to predict weight-at-length, i.e., girth, for a range of standard lengths (30-120 cm). This index was uncorrelated with both the liver condition index and the abundance of Barents Sea capelin (Mallotus villosus), suggesting that at the stock level, the girth of cod is not necessarily indicative of the magnitude of stored energy reserves. Partitioning body size into length-at-age and girth revealed long-term trends in body size. In particular, large/old cod showed substantially higher values of both length-at-age and girth that could be the result of long-term increases in fishing mortality. © 2004 {NRC} Canada.},

	abstract = {Background: The movement and habitat use patterns of medium-bodied nearshore sharks are poorly understood. However, these species face some of the highest levels of exposure to anthropogenic development. The habitat and space use strategies species exhibit affect their role within communities and how they respond to environmental change. The present study used passive acoustic telemetry to evaluate the residency, space use, and habitat use patterns of the creek whaler Carcharhinus fitzroyensis in a nearshore embayment in Queensland, Australia. Results: Individuals were monitored for approximately 18 months. Half of the monitored population were highly resident to the bay. In contrast, several individuals spent less than 2 weeks in the bay, suggesting that broader movements may occur in a portion of the population. Size had no effect on residency. Activity space size varied between months and time of day but was also not affected by animal size. All C. fitzroyensis spent the majority of time in seagrass habitat (70\%) and deep water ({\textgreater}5 m) mud substrate (20\%). Shallow mudflat, sandy inshore, and reef habitats were rarely used (7\%). Although the sample size of immature individuals was relatively small, results indicated immature and mature C. fitzroyensis shared space and habitats. Conclusions: Overall, C. fitzroyensis used a combination of nearshore movement patterns typically exhibited by small- and large-bodied species. The movement patterns exhibited by C. fitzroyensis suggest that this species has a moderately high degree of seagrass habitat specialisation. Seagrass habitat is typically highly productive and may be an important foraging habitat for this species. Given the consistent use of seagrass habitat, C. fitzroyensis are likely vulnerable to population decline as a result of seagrass habitat loss. Future research should continue to investigate the unique movements of medium-bodied sharks.},

These characteristics are likely (i) central to ecosystem function and stability based on theory, and (ii) widespread across ecosystem types based on empirical observations.

Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes.

	abstract = {Marine reserves are the primary management tool for Guam’s reef fish fishery. While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations.},

These stressors complicate the prioritization of proposed management actions intended to improve conditions for migratory fishes including anadromous salmon and trout. Objectives We describe a multi-scale hybrid mech-anistic-probabilistic simulation model linking migration corridor conditions to fish fitness outcomes. We demonstrate the model's utility using a case study of salmon and steelhead adults in the Columbia River migration corridor exposed to spatially-and temporally varying stressors. Methods The migration corridor simulation model is based on a behavioral decision tree that governs individual interactions with the environment, and an energetic submodel that estimates the hourly costs of migration. Emergent properties of the migration corridor simulation model include passage time, energy use, and survival. Results We observed that the simulated fish's initial energy density, the migration corridor temperatures they experienced, and their history of behavioral thermoregulation were the primary determinants of their fitness outcomes. Insights gained from use of the model might be exploited to identify management interventions that increase successful migration outcomes. Conclusions This paper describes new methods that extend the suite of tools available to aquatic biologists and conservation practitioners.

	abstract = {Precipitation changes projected for the end of the twenty-first century show an increase of more than 50 per cent in the Arctic regions. This marked increase, which is among the highest globally, has previously been attributed primarily to enhanced poleward moisture transport from lower latitudes. Here we use state-of-the-art global climate models to show that the projected increases in Arctic precipitation over the twenty-first century, which peak in late autumn and winter, are instead due mainly to strongly intensified local surface evaporation (maximum in winter), and only to a lesser degree due to enhanced moisture inflow from lower latitudes (maximum in late summer and autumn). Moreover, we show that the enhanced surface evaporation results mainly from retreating winter sea ice, signalling an amplified Arctic hydrological cycle. This demonstrates that increases in Arctic precipitation are firmly linked to Arctic warming and sea-ice decline. As a result, the Arctic mean precipitation sensitivity (4.5 per cent increase per degree of temperature warming) is much larger than the global value (1.6 to 1.9 per cent per kelvin). The associated seasonally varying increase in Arctic precipitation is likely to increase river discharge and snowfall over ice sheets (thereby affecting global sea level), and could even affect global climate through freshening of the Arctic Ocean and subsequent modulations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.},

	abstract = {Freshwater sculpins (Cottidae) are a diverse and ecologically important component of cool- and coldwater ecosystems throughout the northern hemisphere. More than 60 sculpin species occur in a variety of habitats, and sculpin distributions range from highly localized to widespread. Despite the frequently high biomass of sculpins and their numerous ecosystem functions, the traditional fisheries management emphasis on sport fishes has led to a general neglect of small-bodied, nongame fishes, such as sculpins, in both research and management. Ironically, in many coldwater ecosystems, salmonids are used as umbrella species to conserve and protect all aquatic vertebrates; however, many management and conservation goals may be better met by focusing on sculpins. This module arose from a symposium entitled "Ecology and Phylogeny of Freshwater and Diadromous Sculpin," which was held at the 2005 annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society in Anchorage, Alaska, and which brought together researchers studying sculpins from diverse perspectives. The objectives of this special module are to (1) publish a wealth of recent research on sculpins in one place to highlight the various scales at which sculpin research can be informative and useful, (2) stimulate interest in sculpins as targets of research and conservation, and (3) illustrate some conservation needs and management uses of sculpins that are unique from those of salmonids and other sport fishes. The papers in this module cover a range of topics, including phylogenetics of a species complex, tests of behavioral theories, and characteristics of sculpin movements, foraging, and reproduction. Together, these papers illustrate the importance of sculpins to a variety of fish communities and their usefulness in addressing theoretical questions and management objectives.},

Knowing how the structure and function of arctic terrestrial ecosystems are responding to recent and persistent climate change is paramount to understanding the future state of the Earth system and how humans will need to adapt. Our holistic review presents a broad array of evidence that illustrates con- vincingly; the Arctic is undergoing a system-wide response to an altered climatic state. New extreme and seasonal surface climatic conditions are being experienced, a range of biophysical states and pro- cesses influenced by the threshold and phase change of freezing point are being altered, hydrological and biogeochemical cycles are shifting, and more regularly human sub-systems are being affected. Importantly, the patterns, magnitude and mechanisms of change have sometimes been unpredictable or difficult to isolate due to compounding factors. In almost every discipline represented, we show how the biocomplexity of the Arctic system has highlighted and challenged a paucity of integrated scientific knowledge, the lack of sustained observational and experimental time series, and the techni- cal and logistic constraints of researching the Arctic environment.

Acceleration in the decline is evident as the extent and area trends of the entire ice cover (seasonal and perennial ice) have shifted ftom about -2.2 and -3.0\% per decade in 1979-1996 to about -10.1 and -10.7\% per decade in the last 10 years. The latter trends are now comparable to the high negative trends of -10.2 and -11.4\% per decade for the perennial ice extent and area, 1979-2007.},

	abstract = {Recent major reductions in summer arctic sea ice extent could be expected to be affecting the distributions and life histories of arctic marine biota adapted to living adjacent to sea ice. Of major concern are the effects of ice reductions, and associated increasing {SST}, on the most abundant forage fish in the Arctic, Arctic cod (. Boreogadus saida), the primary prey for the region's upper trophic level marine predators. The black guillemot (. Cepphus grylle mandtii) is an ice-obligate diving seabird specializing in feeding on Arctic cod and has been studied annually since 1975 at a breeding colony in the western Beaufort Sea. The data set is one of the few allowing assessment of the response of an upper trophic marine predator to recent decadal changes in the region's cryosphere. Analysis of oceanographic conditions north of the colony from 1975 to 2012 for the annual period when parents provision young (mid-July to early September), found no major regime shifts in ice extent or {SST} until the late 1990s with major decreases in ice and increases in {SST} in the first decade of the 21st Century. We examined decadal variation in late summer oceanographic conditions, nestling diet and success, and overwinter adult survival, comparing a historical period (1975-1984) with a recent (2003-2012) one. In the historical period sea ice retreated an average of 1.8. km per day from 15 July to 1 September to an average distance of 95.8. km from the colony, while in the recent period ice retreat averaged 9.8. km per day to an average distance of 506.9. km for the same time period. {SST} adjacent to the island increased an average of 2.9. °C between the two periods.While Arctic cod comprised over 95\% of the prey provided to nestlings in the historical period, in the recent period 80\% of the years had seasonal decreases, with Arctic cod decreasing to {\textless}5\% of the nestling diet, and nearshore demersals, primarily sculpin (Cottidae), comprising the majority of the diet. A five-fold increase in the rate of nestling starvation and reductions in nestling growth and fledging mass were associated with the shift from Arctic cod. Annual adult survival during the nonbreeding season (September-May), showed no significant difference between the two periods, indicating no major change in availability of Arctic cod or other prey in the wintering area in the Bering Sea. Our findings of a substantial decrease in Arctic cod availability in late summer in response to decreased ice extent and increasing {SST} have implications for the entire Arctic given the ongoing and predicted basin-wide reductions in sea ice.},

This potential weakness in ecological interpretation can be overcome by using other investigative tools that provide precise information about individual movement patterns. In this paper, we demonstrate the value of combining {SIA} with telemetry or mark-recapture data from trapping, electrofishing and remote detection of individuals to study the movement and feeding ecology of fishes in different habitats. In a fjord lake system in Newfoundland, Canada, juvenile Atlantic salmon delayed downstream migration (smolts) or actively moved into a large lake (parr) where they foraged for periods reflecting different life history strategies. In the Miramichi River (New Brunswick, Canada), {SIA} provided evidence of distinct foraging habitats (tributary versus large river). By tracking fish implanted with passive integrated transponder ({PIT}) tags, we distinguished between movements related to foraging versus seeking cool water refugia during high temperature events. Finally, site fidelity and limited mobility of slimy sculpin, a small benthic fish, was established where δ13C in muscle tissue showed a progressive enrichment downstream and where a median displacement of {\textless}10 m was estimated for sculpin tagged with {PIT} tags. Technological improvements have permitted non-destructive tissue sampling of wild fishes for {SIA}, and the tagging and remote detection of animals smaller than was previously possible. These advancements and the combination of investigative tools promise new insights into animal ecology. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

This study provides the quantification of macrozooplankton and nekton distributions during the polar night in a partially ice-covered high Arctic fjord. In January 2012, mid-water trawls and {MIK} nets were deployed in Rijpfjorden, Svalbard (80° 18′ N, 22° 15′ E) at three depths (20, 75 and 200 m) day and night. Simultaneously, acoustic volume backscattering strength (a measure of biomass) was recorded using 18-, 38- and 120-{kHz} echosounders. We observed that the majority of nekton were below the thermocline ({\textgreater}100 m) day and night. A diverse fish community (10 species present) dominated the nekton biomass closely followed by shrimp and squid. Macrozooplankton, mostly large Calanus spp. copepods and gelatinous zooplankton, were found throughout the water column, but the majority were above the thermocline day and night. A general additive model with depth, time and moonlight predicted biomass to increase with depth for both macrozooplankton (over the top 100 m) and nekton, but revealed no patterns in biomass over time. The model also indicated that full moon presence increased depth of macrozooplankton backscatter. Our findings suggest a diverse and to some degree active pelagic community during the polar night, and provide some support for the hypothesis that moonlight induces downward vertical migrations of macrozooplankton.},

	abstract = {1. Climate change impacts have been observed on individual species and species subsets; however, it remains to be seen whether there are systematic, coherent assemblage-wide responses to climate change that could be used as a representative indicator of changing biological state. 2. European shelf seas are warming faster than the adjacent land masses and faster than the global average. We explore the year-by-year distributional response of North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fishes to temperature change over the 25 years from 1980 to 2004. The centres of latitudinal and depth distributions of 28 fishes were estimated from species-abundance-location data collected on an annual fish monitoring survey. 3. Individual species responses were aggregated into 19 assemblages reflecting physiology (thermal preference and range), ecology (body size and abundance-occupancy patterns), biogeography (northern, southern and presence of range boundaries), and susceptibility to human impact (fishery target, bycatch and non-target species). 4. North Sea winter bottom temperature has increased by 1.6 degrees C over 25 years, with a 1 degrees C increase in 1988-1989 alone. During this period, the whole demersal fish assemblage deepened by similar to 3.6 m decade(-1) and the deepening was coherent for most assemblages. 5. The latitudinal response to warming was heterogeneous, and reflects (i) a northward shift in the mean latitude of abundant, widespread thermal specialists, and (ii) the southward shift of relatively small, abundant southerly species with limited occupancy and a northern range boundary in the North Sea. 6. Synthesis and applications. The deepening of North Sea bottom-dwelling fishes in response to climate change is the marine analogue of the upward movement of terrestrial species to higher altitudes. The assemblage-level depth responses, and both latitudinal responses, covary with temperature and environmental variability in a manner diagnostic of a climate change impact. The deepening of the demersal fish assemblage in response to temperature could be used as a biotic indicator of the effects of climate change in the North Sea and other semi-enclosed seas.},

	abstract = {The increase in species richness from the poles to the Equator has been observed in numerous terrestrial and aquatic taxa. A number of different hypotheses have been put forward as explanations for this trend, e.g. area and energy availability. However, whether these hypotheses apply to large spatial scales in marine environments remains unclear. The present study shows a clear latitudinal gradient from high to low latitude (from 80 degrees N to 70 degrees S) in marine species richness for 6643 species (fishes and invertebrates) in 10 different taxa dwelling in benthic and pelagic habitats on both sides of the Atlantic. The patterns in benthic taxa are strongly influenced by coastal hydrographic processes, with marked peaks and troughs, and consequently the gradients are not symmetric along both Atlantic sides. Pelagic taxa show a plateau-shaped distribution and the influence from coastal events on gradients could not be demonstrated. The relationships between species richness and different environmental factors indicate that area size does not explain the latitudinal pattern in benthic species richness on a large spatial scale. Sea-surface temperature (positive relationship) is the best predictor of this pattern for benthic species, and nitrate concentration (negative relationship) is the best predictor for pelagic species. The results call into question the existence of a single primary cause that would explain the pattern in marine species richness on a large spatial scale.},

However, there is substantial debate regarding the trophic role of crayfish and implications of their foraging behavior on littoral ecosystems. We created a bioenergetics model for rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus)to determine how growth and prey choice constrain crayfish consumption, which affects littoral ecosystems. We simulated over 6400 potential rusty crayfish diets by varying the abundance of important prey. We judged how crayfish prey choice affects the amount and identity of prey that crayfish must consume to match observed growth. We compared our model predictions with stable isotope evidence from 10 northern Wisconsin lakes to determine energy sources and trophic position of rusty crayfish relative to other invertebrates. Our diet simulations and stable isotope analysis con- curred that crayfish of all ages are primarily predators. Individuals that do not feed on zoobenthos must therefore con- sume large quantities of less desirable food such as macrophytes, which are an important component of littoral habitat.},

	abstract = {Young-of-the-year ({YOY}) walleye (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum) growth is a vital step in walleye recruitment. An individual-based model ({IBM}) was developed to describe the growth of {YOY} walleye in Oneida Lake (New York, {USA}) and Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, {USA}). In Oneida Lake the only prey species included in the model was yellow perch (Perca flavescens), whereas both yellow perch and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were prey species in the model for Lake Mendota. {IBM} predictions for length frequencies of the {YOY} walleye population at the end of the growing season showed good agreement with observed length frequencies. A theoretical relationship was derived between the en- counter rate, X, used in the {IBM} and the half-saturation constant, k, used in a type {II} functional response model. Estimates of k from the two models showed good agreement, thus corroborating the value of X chosen for the {IBM} application to Oneida Lake. The mean length of the {YOY} walleye cohort and the percentage of larger (- 175 mm in total length) walleyes in the cohort at the end of the growing season were most sensitive to gross growth efficiency, bioenergetics parameters for maximum daily consumption by walleyes, and the ratio of prey length to predator length at which the prey is susceptible to predation. In Lake Mendota the vulnerability of bluegills to predation by {YOY} walleyes was especially important in determining the growth of walleyes during their first growing season. The {IBM} approach was valuable for modeling those stages of life history in which characteristics of the individual were critical in determining recruitment. Key},

	abstract = {We evaluated the Wisconsin bioenergetics model for lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in the laboratory and in the field. For the laboratory evaluation, lake whitefish were fed rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax in four laboratory tanks during a 133-d experiment. Based on a comparison of bioenergetics model predictions of lake whitefish food consumption and growth with observed consumption and growth, we concluded that the bioenergetics model furnished significantly biased estimates of both food consumption and growth. On average, the model overestimated consumption by 61\% and underestimated growth by 16\%. The source of the bias was probably an overestimation of the respiration rate. We therefore adjusted the respiration component of the bioenergetics model to obtain a good fit of the model to the observed consumption and growth in our laboratory tanks. Based on the adjusted model, predictions of food consumption over the 133-d period fell within 5\% of observed consumption in three of the four tanks and within 9\% of observed consumption in the remaining tank. We used polychlorinated biphenyls ({PCBs}) as a tracer to evaluate model performance in the field. Based on our laboratory experiment, the efficiency with which lake whitefish retained {PCBs} from their food (gamma) was estimated at 0.45. We applied the bioenergetics model to Lake Michigan lake whitefish and then used {PCB} determinations of both lake whitefish and their prey from Lake Michigan to estimate gamma in the field. Application of the original model to Lake Michigan lake whitefish yielded a field estimate of 0.28, implying that the original formulation of the model overestimated consumption in Lake Michigan by 61\%. Application of the bioenergetics model with the adjusted respiration component resulted in a field gamma estimate of 0.56, implying that this revised model underestimated consumption by 20\%.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0101495},
	abstract = {Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic than other places in the world, which is likely to alter the distribution and abundance of migratory birds breeding there. A warming climate can provide benefits to birds by decreasing spring snow cover, but increases in the frequency of summer rainstorms, another product of climate change, may reduce foraging opportunities for insectivorous birds. Cyclic lemming populations in the Arctic also influence bird abundance because Arctic foxes begin consuming bird eggs when lemmings decline. The complex interaction between summer temperature, precipitation, and the lemming cycle hinder our ability to predict how Arctic-breeding birds will respond to climate change. The main objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between annual variation in weather, spring snow cover, lemming abundance and spatiotemporal variation in the abundance of multiple avian guilds in a tundra ecosystem in central Nunavut, Canada: songbirds, shorebirds, gulls, loons, and geese. We spatially stratified our study area based on vegetation productivity, terrain ruggedness, and freshwater abundance, and conducted distance sampling to estimate strata-specific densities of each guild during the summers of 2010-2012. We also monitored temperature, rainfall, spring snow cover, and lemming abundance each year. Spatial variation in bird abundance matched what was expected based on previous ecological knowledge, but weather and lemming abundance also significantly influenced the abundance of some guilds. In particular, songbirds were less abundant during the cool, wet summer with moderate snow cover, and shorebirds and gulls declined with lemming abundance. The abundance of geese did not vary over time, possibly because benefits created by moderate spring snow cover were offset by increased fox predation when lemmings were scarce. Our study provides an example of a simple way to monitor the correlation between weather, spring snow cover, lemming abundance, and spatiotemporal variations in Arctic-breeding birds.},

	abstract = {© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.  Trophic ecology of most demersal Arctic fishes remains one of the major knowledge gaps for understanding food web dynamics and connectivity among ecosystems. In this study, fatty acids ({FA}) and stable isotopes ({SI}) were used to study the feeding ecology of seven species (n = 106) of the most abundant benthic fishes (eelpouts, sculpins and agonids) in the Canadian Beaufort Sea from shallow (20–75 m), slope (200–350 m) and deep (500–1000 m) habitats. Both {FA} and {SI} results revealed among- and within-species variability in diet composition. Correspondence analysis of {FA} signatures identified high within-species variability in diet, resulting in high overlap among species. Calanus-derived {FA} were present in all species (Calanus markers up to 13 \% of total {FA}) and were particularly important in Ribbed Sculpin, Adolf’s and Longear Eelpout collected in deep habitats, suggesting a strong contribution of pelagic-derived {FA} to benthic fish communities. Incorporation of this signal in the benthos may result from either direct consumption of deep overwintering copepods (i.e., off-bottom feeding) or through detrital accumulation in benthic invertebrate prey. Mean {SI} values differed among species and indicated that a large range of trophic positions (δ 15 N varied from 14.09 to 17.71 ‰ for Canadian Eelpout and Adolf’s Eelpout, respectively) and carbon dietary sources are preyed upon (δ 13 C range from −21.13 to −23.85 ‰ for Longear Eelpout and Ribbed Sculpin, respectively). {SI} analyses suggested that most species examined were low- to mid-trophic generalist benthic carnivores, with the exception of Ribbed Sculpin, which was a low-trophic pelagic predator.},

Because these species share many characteristics, data from the two species have previously been pooled when assessing marine metal contamination. A chemical and histological study was conducted on fourhorn and shorthorn sculpins collected around a contaminated lead-zinc mine at East Greenland to investigate whether there were any differences in the residues of metals, histopathology and parasites in liver and gills between the two sculpin species. The results demonstrated that concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) were significantly higher in the fourhorn sculpins (p{\textless}0.001) while there were no significant differences for arsenic (As) or cadmium (Cd). Furthermore, density of blood vessel fibrosis (p=0.028), prevalence and density of chondroplasia (p=0.002 and p=0.005, respectively), number of mucin-containing mucous cells (p{\textless}0.001) and chloride cells (p{\textless}0.001) and mean intensity of colonial Peritricha (p{\textless}0.001) were significantly higher in fourhorn sculpin. Based on these results we suggest that pooling the two species when conducting environmental assessments is not recommended as it can lead to incorrect conclusions. We propose that a larger study investigating the biological effects of zinc-lead mining in Greenland is needed.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the reproductive seasonality of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), a small-bodied, benthic spring spawning species. Sculpin are unique compared with other temperate fish species because they have a reproductive pattern where gonadal maturation occurs over winter in northern areas of its distribution. Previous studies have involved pre-spawning sampling (early spring in North America) and post-spawning sampling (early fall in North America). However, seasonal changes in gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, condition factor, and in vitro gonadal production of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) in females and T and 11-ketotestosterone (11-{KT}) in males have not been characterized. Following a summer quiescent period, female sculpin showed an increase in gonadal hormone production during the fall, which was associated with increases in gonad and liver sizes, however males experienced a much shorter resting phase following spawning in May. Elevated production of both T and 11-{KT} appears to both signal the initiation of gonadal growth in September and contribute to gonadal maturation over the winter. This study is important because it is the first characterization of the seasonal reproductive pattern in sculpin and it describes the patterns of gonad development and seasonal changes in condition and liver size in this species as it prepares for spawning.},

Despite a large degree of spatial separation, some species did overlap, with slimy and deepwater sculpin occurring in sympatry throughout the year in the offshore and transitional zones, and round goby overlapping with both sculpin species seasonally in the transitional zone. Deepwater sculpin exhibited specialization on Mysis diluviana in all depth regions. Slimy sculpin in the offshore reduced diet overlap with deepwater sculpin by specializing on fish eggs during spring and fall, whereas in the transitional depth zone, there was considerable overlap between sculpin species due to the high importance of Mysis in diets. The invasive round goby had a mixed diet, with some diet overlap with native sculpin, especially slimy sculpin, in the transitional zone. In the nearshore zone, round goby displayed a generalized diet with many prey contributing to the diet, but the average contribution of any prey was generally low. Spatial separation and variable feeding strategies help reduce, but not eliminate shared resource use amongst these benthic fish in Lake Michigan.},

The sculpin had fed extensively on both benthic and semi-pelagic crustaceans, including large cyclopoid copepods, Mysis relicta, Pallasea quadrispinosa, Monoporeia affinis, Gammaracanthus lacustris, and Saduria entomon.Based on an extensive literature review a series of ecological and evolutionary reasons for a pelagic behavior of this profundal coldwater fish is suggested . Nocturnal, semi-pelagic feeding, and consecutive, thermotactic, vertical migrations up in midwater as shown by Wurtsbaugh \& Neverman (1988) in order to maximize energy intake after feeding, are possible adaptations of these juvenile sculpin for mini- mizing size-dependent mortality due to intra- and interspecific predation and competition from other deep- water fishes.},

We conclude that sculpins actively move to specific spawning beaches and that the initiation of their movements precedes the start of spawning. Sculpin predation on sockeye eggs is positively dependent on sculpin size and on the state of the eggs (fresh versus water hardened), with the largest sculpins able to consume nearly 50 fresh eggs at a single feeding and 130 over a 7-day period. The number of sculpins in sockeye nests is greatest at the beginning of the spawning run, lowest in the middle, and high again at the end, with peak numbers of over 100 sculpins per nest (1 m2). We discuss the results in terms of energy flow of marine-derived nutrients into an oligotrophic system and in terms of the coevolution of sockeye spawning behavior and the predatory behavior of sculpins.},

Although considered important in food webs, little is known about their food habits throughout this region. To address this knowledge gap, we examined and compared the diets of 515 Arctic staghorn sculpin and 422 shorthorn sculpin using stomachs collected over three summers in the northeastern Chukchi Sea (2010–2012) and one summer in the western Beaufort Sea (2011). We used permutational multivariate analysis of variance ({PERMANOVA}) and non-metric multidimensional scaling ({nMDS}) to compare sculpin diets between regions and selected size classes. Differences in mouth morphologies and predator size versus prey size relationships were examined using regression techniques. Arctic staghorn sculpin and shorthorn sculpin diet compositions differed greatly throughout the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Regardless of body size, the smaller-mouthed Arctic staghorn sculpin consumed mostly benthic amphipods and polychaetes, whereas the larger-mouthed shorthorn sculpin shifted from a diet composed of benthic and pelagic macroinvertebrates as smaller individuals to shrimps and fish prey as larger individuals. Within shared habitats, the sculpins appear to partition prey, either by taxa or size, in a manner that suggests no substantial overlap occurs between species. This study increases knowledge of sculpin feeding ecology in the western Arctic and offers regional, quantitative diet information that could support current and future food web modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic telemetry provides an important tool to study the spatial ecology and behaviour of organisms in marine and freshwater systems, but understanding the detection range of acoustic receivers is critical for interpreting acoustic data and establishing receiver spacing to maximize study efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986-2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 ± 0.4; mean ± 1 {SE}). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Vessel noise is a known anthropogenic disturbance but its effects on Arctic fish are largely unknown. Using acoustic telemetry – Vemco® Positioning System ({VPS}) – we quantified home ranges and fine-scale movement types ({MT}) of Shorthorn Sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), a common benthic Arctic fish, in response to vessels and environmental drivers during open water over three years (2012-2014). Low overlap of core home ranges (50\%) for all years and a change of overall {MT} proportions (significant in 2012 only) were observed when vessels were present compared to absent. However, changes in {MTs} associated with vessel presence were not consistent between years. Photoperiod was the only environmental driver that influenced (R2=0.32) {MTs} of sculpin. This is the first study of vessel impacts on arctic fish using acoustic telemetry and demonstrates that individuals alter their behavior and home ranges when vessels are present. Given Draft increasing vessel traffic in the Arctic, additional study on the impact of vessels on these ecosystems is warranted.},

We evaluated nonspawning movement of 3,353 marked Potomac sculpin Cottus girardi over a 1-year period on a 3.14-km segment of a third-order stream. In addition, we conducted a fish removal experiment at the pool–riffle sequence scale (90 m) to evaluate the effects of fish density on movement and recolonization rates. The majority of recaptured Potomac sculpin stayed within 30 m of their original capture location throughout the study (81\% at 30 d; 64\% at 75 d; 53\% at 363 d). Upstream ({US}) movement was greater than downstream ({DS}) movement at 30 d ({US} 17\%;{DS}3\%), 75 d ({US} 30\%,{DS}6\%) and 363 d ({US} 32\%,{DS} 15\%). After 75 d, 10\% of the fish that moved upstream moved more than 250 m (21\% after 363 d). The maximum distance moved was 1,711 m in 75 d. There were no significant differences in mean total length between recaptured Potomac sculpin that either moved or did not move or between upstream and downstream movers. The presence or absence of fishes in adjacent 30-m habitat sections influenced upstream, but not downstream, movement of Potomac sculpin. After 30 d, Potomac sculpin population densities and size structure were similar between fish removal and reference sections. We found our results to be similar to those of other studies, which found that, on average, freshwater sculpin are sedentary. However, we identified great dispersal capabilities (.250 m) for a small percentage of Potomac sculpin. The long dispersal distances suggest that this typically sedentary species may need greater habitat connectivity than previously assumed.},

	abstract = {© Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. Administered by the Arctic Institute of North America. Radio telemetry and t-bar tagging were used to locate sites used by Hornaday River Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) for overwintering, spawning, and summer feeding. Thirty char, 21 in August 1995 and nine in July and August 1999, were captured, radio-tagged, and released back into the Hornaday River. Tracking was done over 14 months in 1995-96 and over three months in 1999, using either aircraft (10 flights) or snowmobiles traveling on the river ice in winter (7 trips). Of 12 radio-tagged char that were relocated during winter 1995-96 and not caught in the 1995 upstream migration fall fishery, 11 (92\%) ultimately overwintered in the reach of the Hornaday between Coalmine and Akluk Creek; three of these did so in consecutive years. This area is characterized by groundwater inputs and deep pools ( {\textgreater}  2 m) that do not freeze to the riverbed in winter. Another important overwintering site was found in a similarly deep channel on the west side of the Hornaday River estuary, where half of the char radio-tagged in fall 1999 spent the winter of 1999-2000. Spawning locations were discerned through circumstantial evidence from the movements of three radio-tagged fish over entire annual cycles. The locations that were indicated as spawning habitat were all in the main stem of the Hornaday River, in deep ( {\textgreater}  2 m), groundwater-fed pools between Coalmine and Akluk Creek. Fourteen percent of 239 char t-bar tagged at Pearce Point in July-August 1997 were caught at the mouth of the Hornaday River, on average within 25 days of tagging, which indicates that the nearshore area of Pearce Point, characterized by upwelling and enhanced productivity, is an important summer feeding area for this stock. This identification of overwintering, spawning, and summer feeding habitats contributes to an emerging list of areas for which it would be prudent to monitor habitat quality, change, and integrity given contemporary changes in climate and the potential for near-future anthropogenic activities in this watershed.},

We attempted to trace the extent and patterns of movement over the life history of individual fish using elemental signatures deposited in otoliths of fish that reflect distinctive freshwater chemistries. Patterns of movement were highly variable within both species of fish among the rivers examined. Patterns included movement among major river systems, use of smaller tributaries within a river, but also some individuals exhibited limited movement. Although the diversity of water chemistry signatures varied among watersheds, this was not reflected in a difference between the two species. There was a tendency for less variability in elemental signatures during the older life stages of the fish, particularly for sculpin. The life history information gained in this study demonstrates that both species make extensive movements within a watershed during their life history. Our otolith microchemistry analysis suggests excellent dispersal abilities, and reveals that, despite being referred to as migratory and resident, putative movements by many individuals from both species were extensive.},

	abstract = {1-2 2 notes: Summary: Shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) from Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, is a slow growing long-lived species. A wide range of diet items were present in the stomachs of the shorthorn sculpins sampled but 2-3 diet items (amphipod species) comprised 99.5 \% of total food consumed. These amphipods were present in the stomachs in similar proportions among all age classes of shorthorn sculpin. Several new host records for parasites were reported and mean numbers of parasite species increased with shorthorn sculpin age. The increased diversity of parasite species and higher δ15N values in older/larger individuals suggest that their diets were more diverse and the prey items consumed had higher δ15N values. By contrast, the value of δ13C in dominant diet items masked the δ13C values of minor diet items. We conclude that parasites and stable isotope values provide complementary data on feeding patterns of the shorthorn sculpin. The ubiquitous marine acanthocephalan, Echinorhynchus gadi, was found at high prevalences (87-100 \%) and mean intensities (28-35), and were localized in the midgut. In contrast to other studies on acanthocephalans, E. gadi did not influence fish condition as measured by condition factor, liver somatic and gonado-somatic indices. {KEY}},

The knowledge of how gut functions in fish are affected by environmental temperature is sparse, and in order to understand how changes in climate may affect fish populations, we need to understand how gut blood flow and gut motility are affected by changes in temperature. By simultaneous recording of gut blood flow, gut motility, cardiac output, heart rate and cardiac stroke volume, in vivo at 4, 9 and 14 A degrees C, the acute thermal sensitivity of a thermal generalist (shorthorn sculpin Myoxocephalu scorpius) was compared to the more strictly Arctic species (Arctic sculpin M. scorpioides). Temperature effects on gut motility were further explored in vitro, using isolated smooth muscles. Elevated water temperatures increased gut blood flow and contractile activity. Contraction frequency increased nearly threefold and gut blood flow almost doubled with the 10 A degrees C increase. Both cardiac output and heart rate increased with temperature, while cardiac stroke volume decreased. The cholinergic agonist carbachol was most potent on smooth muscles at 9 A degrees C. There were no differences between the two species, suggesting that the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems of Arctic sculpin, although a more pronounced Arctic species, have similar abilities to cope with acute fluctuations in water temperature as shorthorn sculpin. The impact of increased gut activity at higher temperatures needs further investigation before the effects of climate change can be predicted},

	volume = {173},
	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have greatly altered the natural flow regime of lotic ecosystems in many ways, including dams and culverts, which restrict sediment transport and fragment fish habitat. Sculpins, Cottus spp., are an important food-web link between macroinvertebrates and larger stream fishes and are greatly affected by culverts. Results from a previous study indicate a substantial increase in the relative abundance of mottled sculpin, Cottus bairdii, was observed upstream of a renovated road-stream crossing during the first season after construction. Redistribution of this nature from a putatively sedentary species would have required substantial movement. Our objectives were to quantify post- restoration mottled sculpin movement and habitat use in a restored stream reach. The extent of post-restoration mottled sculpin movement and habitat use were directly measured using telemetry of Passive Integrated Transponder ({PIT}) tag-marked fish. The maximum linear distance moved by a marked mottled sculpin was 839 m; 23\% of marked mottled sculpin moved .100 m. The number of detections of marked mottled sculpin in each segment was significantly correlated with the amount of small wood (5–10 cm diameter). Increased distribution of mottled sculpin in previously unavailable upstream habitats coupled with substantial post-restoration movement distances provides new insight on their potential for redistribution following habitat reconnection, which is an important consideration for stream restoration projects.},

	doi = {10.1029/2019WR024873},
	abstract = {Abstract High-resolution raster hydrography maps are a fundamental data source for many geoscience applications. Here we introduce {MERIT} Hydro, a new global flow direction map at 3 arc-second resolution ({\textasciitilde}90 m at the equator) derived from the latest elevation data ({MERIT} {DEM}) and water body datasets (G1WBM, {GSWO}, and {OpenStreetMap}). We developed a new algorithm to extract river networks near-automatically by separating actual inland basins from dummy depressions caused by the errors in input elevation data. After a minimum amount of hand-editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with existing quality-controlled river network datasets in terms of flow accumulation area and river basin shape. The location of river streamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global river channel data. Relative error in the drainage area was {\textless}0.05 for 90\% of {GRDC} gauges, confirming the accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation area were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally connected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries. {MERIT} Hydro improves on existing global hydrography datasets in terms of spatial coverage (between N90 and S60) and representation of small streams, mainly due to increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial datasets. The new flow direction and flow accumulation maps, along with accompanying supplementary layers on hydrologically adjusted elevation and channel width, will advance geoscience studies related to river hydrology at both global and local scales.},

The prolongation of the growing season in this marine area is much stronger than that known from terrestrial areas. The growing season, defined by biomass or chl a thresholds, increased by 125 or 129 d, respectively, and extends recently from February to December. The spring bloom started earlier at a rate of 1.4 d yr−1 and the end of the autumn bloom was delayed by 3.1 d yr−1. The duration of the growing season increased at a rate of 4.5 d yr−1. The earlier start of the growing sea- son was correlated with a slight increase in sunshine duration during spring, whereas the later end of the growing season was correlated with a strong increase in water temperature in autumn. The period with sea surface temperature {\textgreater}10°C shifted towards the end of November. Correlations of the duration of the growing season with the phosphate and nitrate concentrations were probably not causative. The shifts in the spring and autumn blooms led to a prolongation of the summer biomass minimum. The earlier spring bloom was caused, among other factors, by a shift of the biomass maximum of the dominant diatom Skeletonema marinoi from May to February/March. The delay in the autumn bloom was induced by a retardation of dominant dinoflagellates and diatoms, such as Ceratium spp. and Dactyliosolen fragilissimus.},

	abstract = {Migration occurs when key aspects of the life cycle such as growth, reproduc- tion, or maintenance cannot all be completed in one location. The Arctic habitats are variable and Arctic species are often migratory. The predictable nature of migrations in both space and time allow Arctic people to harvest fishes and marine mammals. We describe migratory/dispersal behavior in four types of taxa from the Canadian Arctic: anadromous and freshwater fishes, marine fishes, marine inver- tebrates, and marine mammals. Patterns of migration are remarkably different between these groups, in particular between distances migrated, seasonal timing of migrations, and the degree of reproductive isolation. Migratory anadromous and freshwater fishes become adapted to specific locations resulting in complex life his- tories and intra- and inter-population variation. Marine mammals not only migrate longer distances but also appear to have distinct demographic populations over large scales. Marine fishes tend to be panmictic, probably due to the absence of barriers that would restrict gene flow. Migratory patterns also reflect feeding or rearing areas and/or winter refugia. Migratory patterns of harvested aquatic organisms in the Canadian north are extremely variable and have shaped the north in terms of harvest, communities, and culture.},

Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60\% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services.

	abstract = {1.Macroparasites may be a major factor shaping animal behaviour. Tundra ecosystems inhabited by caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are known for large concentrations of ectoparasites including mosquitoes (Culicidae) and black flies (Simuliidae), as well as endoparasitic oestrid flies (Oestridae). 2.Increased intensity and duration of insect harassment because of climatic warming is hypothesized as a potential factor in recent declines of Rangifer across the circumpolar north. Although there is a well-observed relationship between insect harassment and caribou/reindeer behaviour, the influence of ecto- relative to endoparasitic species is unclear. Climatic changes may favour the activity patterns, distribution or abundance of certain insect species; thus, understanding differential effects on the behaviour of Rangifer is important. 3.We recorded caribou behaviour using group scan and focal sampling methods, while simultaneously trapping insects and recording weather conditions on the postcalving/summer range of the Bathurst barren-ground caribou herd in Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada, during 2007-2009. 4.We developed statistical model sets representing hypotheses about the effects of insects, weather, habitat/location, and date/time on caribou behaviour. We used multinomial logistic regression models to explore factors affecting the relative dominance of behaviour types within groups of caribou and fractional multinomial logistic regression models to determine factors influencing time allocation by individual caribou. We examined changes in feeding intensity using fractional logistic regression. 5.Relative dominance of insect avoidance behaviour within caribou groups and time allocation to insect avoidance by individual caribou increased when oestrid flies were present or black flies were active at moderate-high levels. Mosquito activity had relatively little effect on caribou behaviour. Time spent feeding was reduced by the greatest degree when all three insect types were present in combination. Feeding intensity was influenced to a greater extent by the accumulation of growing degree days over the course of the postcalving/summer season than by insect activity. Changes in Arctic systems that increase the activity/abundance of ecto- and endoparasites could have implications for the productivity of Rangifer populations. © 2011 The Authors.

Refining the theory of social capital with the concept of alignment between parents’ and adolescents’ goals and actions, we emphasize the complementarity of extra-group ties as social capital through which parents can effectively bridge resources and information to adolescents, enabling them to make informed choices about college. This study explores conditions that ease the transition to college, especially for students who are disadvantaged (e.g., children of immigrants).Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988-94, a multinomial logistic regression analysis that differentiates among students who choose different pathways after high school graduation (a two-year college, a four-year college or no postsecondary enrollment). A Heckman selection model is used to predict the selectivity of four-year colleges attended by students. Results show that alignment of parents’ and students’ goals increases students’ odds of attending a postsecondary institution in the year after high school graduation. The effect of parents’ education on the selectivity of the college attended is also dependent on aligned ambition and aligned action between parents and adolescents. For example, active participation in postsecondary school guidance programs by parents is more beneficial to students whose parents have lower levels of educational attainment.},

We develop and apply multilevel, multinomial logistic regression models for analyzing such data. These statistical methods correspond to the multinomial character of the response variable while also accounting for the repeated observations of individuals that characterize behavioral datasets. Correlated random effects potentially reveal individual-level trade-offs across behaviors, allowing for models that reveal the extent to which individuals who regularly engage in one behavior also exhibit relatively more or less of another behavior. Using an example dataset, we demonstrate the estimation of these models using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, as implemented in the {RStan} package in the R statistical environment. The supplemental files include a coding script and data that demonstrate auxiliary functions to prepare the data, estimate the models, summarize the posterior samples, and generate figures that display model predictions. We discuss possible extensions to our approach, including models with random slopes to allow individual-level behavioral strategies to vary over time and the need for models that account for temporal autocorrelation. These models can potentially be applied to a broad class of statistical analyses by behavioral ecologists, focusing on other polytomous response variables, such as behavior, habitat choice, or emotional states.},

	abstract = {© 2016 The Authors. Journal of Animal Ecology © 2016 British Ecological Society Understanding the limits of consumption is important for determining trophic influences on ecosystems and predator adaptations to inconsistent prey availability. Fishes have been observed to consume beyond what is sustainable (i.e. digested on a daily basis), but this phenomenon of hyperphagia (or binge-feeding) is largely overlooked. We expect hyperphagia to be a short-term (1-day) event that is facilitated by gut volume providing capacity to store consumed food during periods of high prey availability to be later digested. We define how temperature, body size and food availability influence the degree of binge-feeding by comparing field observations with laboratory experiments of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), a large freshwater piscivore that experiences highly variable prey pulses. We also simulated bull trout consumption and growth during salmon smolt outmigrations under two scenarios: 1) daily consumption being dependent upon bioenergetically sustainable rates and 2) daily consumption being dependent upon available gut volume (i.e. consumption is equal to gut volume when empty and otherwise ‘topping off’ based on sustainable digestion rates). One-day consumption by laboratory-held bull trout during the first day of feeding experiments after fasting exceeded bioenergetically sustainable rates by 12- to 87-fold at low temperatures (3 °C) and by ˜1·3-fold at 20 °C. The degree of binge-feeding by bull trout in the field was slightly reduced but largely in agreement with laboratory estimates, especially when prey availability was extremely high [during a sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolt outmigration and at a counting fence where smolts are funnelled into high densities]. Consumption by bull trout at other settings were lower and more variable, but still regularly hyperphagic. Simulations demonstrated the ability to binge-feed increased cumulative consumption (16–32\%) and cumulative growth (19–110\%) relative to only feeding at bioenergetically sustainable rates during the ˜1-month smolt outmigration period. Our results indicate the ability for predators to maximize  short-term consumption when prey are available can be extreme and is limited primarily by gut volume, then mediated by temperature; thus, predator–prey relationships may be more dependent upon prey availability than traditional bioenergetic models suggest. Binge-feeding has important implications for energy budgets of consumers as well as acute predation impacts on prey.},

In eastern North America, European brown trout generally dominates over, and eventually replaces, the native brook trout. We show here that in northern Europe the pattern of replacement between these two species is reversed: when transferred to North European streams, brook trout spread extensively and partially replaced the native brown trout. The effect of brook trout on brown trout was habitat-specific: brook trout excluded the native species only in small tributary streams where the reproduction of brown trout was severely reduced, whereas in larger streams brown trout was largely unaffected. Thus, the pattern of coexistence among the two salmonids in our study area is approaching that typically observed in North American streams. In both areas, brook trout ultimately settles in small headwater streams, but the process of replacement differs profoundly: in North Europe, brook trout replaces brown trout in headwater streams, whereas in North America these same streams are the ultimate refuge area for brook trout under the invasion pressure by brown trout. Our results underline the importance of knowing species' niche characteristics to explain and predict biological invasions. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the {USA}.},

Alewife populations then exploded, creating nuisance die-offs. Public demands for action, coupled with control of sea lamprey, allowed fishery managers to consider stocking Pacific salmon to control alewife and establish a recreational fishery. This effort was successful, reducing alewife numbers and creating a recreational fishery that is estimated at \$7 billion annually. This fishery management regime may no longer be viable as new invasive species continue to alter the ecosystem. Fishery managers face an interesting dilemma: whether to manage in the short term for a popular and economically important sport fishery or to embrace ecosystem change and manage primarily for native fish species that appear to be better suited to ongoing ecosystem changes. Such dilemmas occur in great lakes around the world as fishery managers seek to balance economic pressure with changes in their respective ecosystems, often brought about by invasive species.},

We need a better understanding of the biology, population dynamics and ecosystem role of Ammodytes to inform relevant management, climate adaptation and conservation efforts. To meet this need, we synthesized available data on the (a) life history, behaviour and distribution; (b) trophic ecology; (c) threats and vulnerabilities; and (d) ecosystem services role of Ammodytes in the {NWA}. Overall, 72 regional predators including 45 species of fishes, two squids, 16 seabirds and nine marine mammals were found to consume Ammodytes. Priority research needs identified during this effort include basic information on the patterns and drivers in abundance and distribution of Ammodytes, improved assessments of reproductive biology schedules and investigations of regional sensitivity and resilience to climate change, fishing and habitat disturbance. Food web studies are also needed to evaluate trophic linkages and to assess the consequences of inconsistent zooplankton prey and predator fields on energy flow within the {NWA} ecosystem.

In 1995 to 1996, survey responses from agency personnel in 48 states indicated that 22 states used Wr as a standard technique, 18 states identified Wr use as occasional, whereas only eight states indicated no Wr use. The regression-line-percentile technique is recommended for developing standard weight (Ws) equations. There are currently Ws equations available for 52 species and three purposeful hybrids. Length-related trends in condition need to be evaluated prior to calculating a population mean Wr. Relative weight target ranges should be adjusted to meet specific management objectives. Relative weight values are influenced by seasonal dynamics. The uses of Wr may go beyond just a measure of fish "plumpness."

We use downscaled outputs from general circulation models coupled with a hydrologic model to forecast the effects of altered flows and increased temperatures on four interacting species of trout across the interior western United States (1.01 million km 2), based on empirical statistical models built from fish surveys at 9,890 sites. Projections under the 2080s A1B emissions scenario forecast a mean 47\% decline in total suitable habitat for all trout, a group of fishes of major socioeconomic and ecological significance. We project that native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii, already excluded from much of its potential range by nonnative species, will lose a further 58\% of habitat due to an increase in temperatures beyond the species' physiological optima and continued negative biotic interactions. Habitat for nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout Salmo trutta is predicted to decline by 77\% and 48\%, respectively, driven by increases in temperature and winter flood frequency caused by warmer, rainier winters. Habitat for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, is projected to decline the least (35\%) because negative temperature effects are partly offset by flow regime shifts that benefit the species. These results illustrate how drivers other than temperature influence species response to climate change. Despite some uncertainty, large declines in trout habitat are likely, but our findings point to opportunities for strategic targeting of mitigation efforts to appropriate stressors and locations.},

Their diet was dominated by littoral macrobenthos, particularly amphipods (Echinogammarus sp.). There was ontogenetic variation in the diet, with small young-of-the-year (L(F) {\textless} 4 cm) feeding on several littoral microcrustaceans, especially the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia reticulata, whereas larger fish shifted to a freshwater shrimp (Atyaephyra desmaresti), snails and damselfly larvae. Seasonal variation in diet was linked to resource availability, with consumption of fish eggs and plant debris in spring and summer. In autumn, pumpkinseeds were partially zooplanktivores, preying on the cladoceran Daphnia longispina. The diet of pumpkinseeds in Lake Banyoles and other Iberian populations shows less molluscivory than North American populations. The potential ecological impact of this successful exotic species involves mainly predation on fish eggs and molluscs. (C) 2000 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

	doi = {10.1577/t09-115.1},
	abstract = {The energetic benefits enjoyed by consumers in streams with salmon runs depend on how those benefits are accrued. Adult Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. deliver significant amounts of nutrients (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) and carbon to streams when they spawn and die; these nutrient additions can have demonstrable effects on primary production in streams. Consumption of carcass tissues or eggs provides for direct energy subsidies to consumers and may have significant effects on their condition. In this study, comparisons of juvenile coho salmon O. kisutch and aquatic insects exposed to terrestrial and marine energy sources demonstrated that direct consumption of marine-derived lipids had a significant effect on the lipid reserves of consumers. Direct consumption of marine-derived tissues was verified through fatty acid analysis. Selected aquatic insects and juvenile coho salmon were reared for 6 weeks in experimental streams supplied with terrestrial or marine energy sources. Chironomid midges, nemourid stoneflies, and juvenile coho salmon exposed to the marine energy source altered their fatty acid compositions by incorporating the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that are characteristic of marine fish. The fatty acid composition of baetid mayflies was unaffected. The direct movement of specific fatty markers indicated that direct consumption of marine- derived tissues led to increased energy reserves (triacylglycerols) in consumers. Similar results were obtained for juvenile coho salmon sampled from natural streams before and after the arrival of adult salmon runs. These data indicate that marine-derived lipids from anadromous fish runs are an important source of reserve lipids for consumers that overwinter in streams.},

Response of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutchi) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) rearing at these sites was compared with nearby streams where few salmon spawned. Densities of age 0+ coho salmon and age 0+ and age 1+ steelhead increased following carcass additions to the treated streams. A similar increase in density was not observed at the reference sites. Condition factors in treated streams increased following carcass addition and remained at high levels while carcasses were present whereas no similar pattern was observed at the reference sites. Stomach contents of fish in streams to which carcasses had been added consisted primarily of salmon eggs and carcass flesh when carcasses were present in the stream. Stable isotope analysis indicated that the proportion of marine-derived nitrogen in the muscle tissue of juvenile salmonids increased as much as 39\% following carcass placement. Results suggest that eggs and carcasses of adult salmon provide a very important resource during a period when other food items are often scarce. © 1998 {NRC} Canada.},

	abstract = {Pacific salmon (Oncoryhnchus spp.) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) are introduced species stocked in the Laurentian Great Lakes. In their native range, salmon deliver material that enhances growth, alters isotopic ratios, and increases contaminant burdens of resident fish. However, whether salmon subsidies mediate interactions between competing species is unknown. Here, we employed a mesocosm experiment and a simulation model to determine if salmon tissue consumption influences brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) growth, isotopic ratios, and mercury concentrations and whether these were modified by brown trout. Our results indicate that brook trout growth did not increase with provision of salmon tissue and was not reduced by brown trout. However, brook trout exhibited isotopic enrichment and increased mercury concentrations, suggesting dietary intake of salmon tissue. Because salmon eggs have a higher energy density and lower mercury concentration compared with salmon tissue, our simulation model suggests that consumption of salmon eggs rather than tissue can increase growth while reducing mercury accumulation. Overall, our results suggest that the role of introduced Pacific salmon is dependent on both food quantity and quality along with diet contaminant concentrations.},

Mean percentage of empty stomachs was low across all fishes (16.2 ± 1.2\%) but varied from 0\% to 79.4\% among individual species. Nocturnal fishes had empty stomachs more frequently than diurnal fishes. Trophic classification was strongly associated with the percentage of empty stomachs, a pattern also revealed from an intraspecific analysis. Fishes appear to adjust their feeding intervals relative to the energy density, conversion efficiency, and particle size of their food. Piscivorous fishes seem to be the only trophic group that regularly experience long periods of empty stomachs, with species that consume prey whole and those that provide extended parental care having the highest proportions of empty stomachs. Activity patterns and life histories of some piscivorous species probably have evolved in partial response to energetic benefits of large, energy-rich food resources.},

We compared life history parameters in stream-resident populations of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in eight boreal streams. By use of electrofishing data from 1000 sites, we analyzed and related differences in life history traits to habitat- and  interaction-related patterns of growth and densities of brook and brown trout, respectively. Brown trout were competitively dominant throughout the size span of sampled sympatric sites and lowered growth rates in sympatry were mainly caused by environmental factors, revealing a link between brook trout invasions and habitat-related  limitations on brown trout performance. Still, the frequency of allopatric brook trout sites increased in the smallest  watersheds, indicating that localities with a high degree of brook trout dominance rarely sustain brown trout over time. Brook trout populations had higher turnover rates and proportions of mature females than brown trout populations. Our results suggest growth potential and its effect on population fecundity as a critical factor limiting competitive ability and distribution of brown trout in Swedish brook trout dominated headwaters.},

	abstract = {Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were introduced into Lakes Michigan and Huron in the 1960s to diversify recreational fisheries and reduce overabundant, nonnative Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. Alewife remain the primary prey of Chinook Salmon but have experienced substantial declines in abundance due to reduced food resources and salmonine predation pressure. The movements of Chinook Salmon have been linked to the density and spatial distribution of Alewife, but spatial patterns in Chinook Salmon growth have not been well documented and the temporal relationship between growth and Alewife density has not been evaluated during the current period of low Alewife abundance. We evaluated spatial and temporal variation in growth of Chinook Salmon in Lake Michigan and the U.S. waters of Lake Huron and explored linkages with Alewife density. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were generally similar for recaptured coded-wire-tagged Chinook Salmon from different stocking locations and different recovery locations. Only a few small differences among stocking and recovery regions were evident, with regions divided into two subtly different groups with shared growth parameters. The small regional differences may be attributable to unique habitat and/or stocking characteristics of specific regions. In Lake Michigan average Chinook Salmon length at age also varied across years and was tightly coupled with annual lakewide densities of age-1 and older Alewife, suggesting that Chinook Salmon growth from 2012 to 2016 was constrained by Alewife density. Our findings are consistent with evidence of lakewide movements associated with foraging and support continued management of Chinook Salmon in Lake Michigan as a single population. Furthermore, similar growth in Chinook Salmon from Lakes Michigan and Huron corroborates evidence that Chinook Salmon move from U.S. waters of Lake Huron to Lake Michigan to feed and reinforces the recent decision to include most fish stocked in northwestern Lake Huron in the Lake Michigan population when managing for predator–prey balance.},

Owing to their early decline, there is little information about their ecology and life history, yet such information is vital for the ecologically based rehabilitation and management of coasters. This study reviews the ecology of coaster brook trout from a life history perspective and presents quantitative data on the biology and status of the few populations that have been studied. Within the Lake Superior basin, some brook trout are stream residents while others are lacustrine or adfluvial. Although the variation in migratory behavior may be related to individual energetics, the role of evolution and the proximate factors triggering specific life histories remain uncertain. Comparisons of recent biological data from populations in the Lake Superior basin show that the northern populations have longer lengths at age and length frequency distributions skewed toward longer individuals. The degrees to which this difference is driven by variation in individual growth rates and sizeselective mortality are unknown. All known populations around the Lake Superior basin appear to have a small number of individuals and are thus of conservation concern. We believe that biotic interactions such as competition with introduced salmonines (in particular coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch) have a strong negative influence on the individual and population performance of coasters. Coupled with high past and recent mortality from fisheries, these factors may create bottlenecks limiting the growth and rehabilitation of the remnant populations. Lake Superior coaster brook trout are persisting, albeit uncertainly, under conditions different from those in which they once thrived. Management focused on native ecosystem rehabilitation may foster the return of these fish as abundant members of Great Lakes food webs, and recent basinwide restrictions on length and catch limits are a positive step toward enhancing their rehabilitation and evolution.},

Although recent studies have shown a link between metabolism and dominance, these studies relied on single measurements of both, and assumed that inter-individual variation of physiology and behaviour were repeatable over time. This paper demonstrates that standard metabolic rate is a repeatable trait in Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.) and that relative differences between individuals are consistent across a range of environmental conditions. Furthermore, there were positive associations between metabolic rate, aggression, and competitive ability that were also repeatable over time. However, there was no relationship between competitive ability (measured as feeding attempts) and subsequent growth. This may be due to an energetic cost of dominance: high rates of food capture were only attainable through high rates of effort. This, in addition to elevated aggression, was thought to exert an energetic cost that could not be fully offset by the increased food intake.},

	abstract = {Animal tracking and biologging devices record large amounts of data on individual movement behaviors in natural environments. In these data, movement ecologists often view unexplained variation around the mean as “noise” when studying patterns at the population level. In the field of behavioral ecology, however, focus has shifted from population means to the biological underpinnings of variation around means. Specifically, behavioral ecologists use repeated measures of individual behavior to partition behavioral variability into intrinsic among-individual variation and reversible behavioral plasticity and to quantify: a) individual variation in behavioral types (i.e. different average behavioral expression), b) individual variation in behavioral plasticity (i.e. different responsiveness of individuals to environmental gradients), c) individual variation in behavioral predictability (i.e. different residual within-individual variability of behavior around the mean), and d) correlations among these components and correlations in suites of behaviors, called ‘behavioral syndromes’. We here suggest that partitioning behavioral variability in animal movements will further the integration of movement ecology with other fields of behavioral ecology. We provide a literature review illustrating that individual differences in movement behaviors are insightful for wildlife and conservation studies and give recommendations regarding the data required for addressing such questions. In the accompanying R tutorial we provide a guide to the statistical approaches quantifying the different aspects of among-individual variation. We use movement data from 35 African elephants and show that elephants differ in a) their average behavior for three common movement behaviors, b) the rate at which they adjusted movement over a temporal gradient, and c) their behavioral predictability (ranging from more to less predictable individuals). Finally, two of the three movement behaviors were correlated into a behavioral syndrome (d), with farther moving individuals having shorter mean residence times. Though not explicitly tested here, individual differences in movement and predictability can affect an individual’s risk to be hunted or poached and could therefore open new avenues for conservation biologists to assess population viability. We hope that this review, tutorial, and worked example will encourage movement ecologists to examine the biology of individual variation in animal movements hidden behind the population mean.},

Here, we quantified when and where full-depth ({\textgreater} 20 m), solar-mediated {DVM} exists on a pan-Arctic scale. We observed the scattering population, most likely to be comprised of zooplankton, using 300 {kHz} acoustic Doppler current profilers ({ADCPs}). We quantified the presence/absence of {DVM}, and found that {DVM} continues throughout the year to at least 20 m at all locations south of 74° N. North of 77° N, {DVM} ceases for a period of time during the polar night. The dates of this cessation accurately align with the date of the winter solstice (± 2 d). Between 74 and 77° N, {DVM} presence/absence is variable. Acoustic data sampled at 89° N, however, showed no evidence of {DVM} at any time during the year — a new observation. Using indicators of presence/absence of sea ice from {ADCPs} and satellite-derived sea ice concentration data, we revealed that local variations in sea ice cover directly determine the continuation or cessation of {DVM} during the polar night. Earlier-forming and higher-concentration sea ice causes a cessation in {DVM}, whereas low-concentration or late-forming sea ice results in continuous {DVM} when comparing migrations at similar latitudes.},

Most research conducted in polar areas has been carried out during the summer, rarely including aspects of seasonality; therefore, there are gaps in our knowledge of the structure of food webs in the Arctic, particularly information is lacking on the possible shifts in winter feeding strategies of organisms. This study is the ﬁrst to compare potential shifts in benthic food-web structure between winter and summer in a shallow-water Arctic fjord (Kongsfjorden, Svalbard). Winter data were collected in March when conditions are representative of winter and when Arctic shallow benthic fauna is likely to be most affected by absence of fresh food supply as opposed to summer (August). Samples of particulate suspended organic matter ({POM}), settled organic matter, surface sediment and benthic organisms were taken and analyzed for stable isotopes signatures (d13C and d15N). Four relative trophic levels ({TL}) were distinguished in both winter and summer, and no differences in the structure of benthic food web were found between seasons. Our study shows that the shallow sublittoral benthos depends on primary production, fresh and reworked settled organic matter and, to a certain degree, on terrestrial input. We also demonstrate that shallow water polar benthic fauna is characterized by a high level of omnivory and feeds at multiple trophic levels showing strong resilience to changing seasonal conditions.},

By analyzing a large set of pan-arctic observational data compiled from multiple sources, we show that Arctic Calanus has a broad depth distribution in winter, indicating that diapause at depth is a facultative strategy. Both species’ vertical distributions tend to deepen in winter and to be deeper and broader with increasing bottom depth, while individuals are aggregated closer to the sea ﬂoor in shallow areas. These results indicate that Arctic Calanus species pursue a relatively deep diapause habitat but are topographically blocked on the shelves. Interspeciﬁc differences in depth distribution during diapause suggest the importance of predation. The larger C. hyperboreus has a deeper diapause depth than C. glacialis, potentially to alleviate predation pressure or as a result of predation loss near the surface. Moreover, the mean depth of C. hyperboreus in winter is negatively associated with latitude, indicating a shoaling of the diapause population in the central Arctic Ocean where predation pressure is lower. Our results suggest a complex diapause behavior by Arctic Calanus, with implications for our view of the species’ roles in Arctic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Paciﬁc Arctic marine ecosystem extends from the northern Bering Sea, across the Chukchi and into the East Siberian and Beaufort seas. Food webs in this ecosystem are short, a simplicity that belies the biophysical complexity underlying trophic linkages from primary production to humans. Existing advective and pelagicbenthic coupling models describe processes that connect certain aspects of marine food webs, but do not oﬀer a comprehensive approach to understanding the Paciﬁc Arctic ecosystem. In the course of the Synthesis of Arctic Research ({SOAR}) project, the Arctic Marine Pulses ({AMP}) model was developed that depicts seasonal biophysical ‘pulses’ across a latitudinal gradient by linking processes in four previously-deﬁned contiguous ecological domains, including the: (i) Paciﬁc Arctic domain; (ii) Seasonal Ice Zone domain; (iii) the Marginal domain (i.e., the shelf break and slope); and (iv) Riverine Coastal domain. Some of the biophysical processes included in the {AMP} model, such as pelagic-benthic coupling on the broad shelves of the northern Bering and Chukchi seas and advection and upwelling of zooplankton along the western Beaufort shelf (i.e. the krill trap), have been the focus of long-term studies. Other aspects such as biological processes associated with shifts in seasonal sea-ice phenology and trophic responses to riverine outﬂow have received less attention. The {AMP} model provides an annual spatiotemporal framework to guide research on dynamic ecosystem processes during the recent period of rapid biophysical changes in the Paciﬁc Arctic. The model aims to encourage integrated research to track seasonal sea-ice and current-ﬂow dynamics, coincident with variability in nutrients, benthic and pelagic production, and upper-trophic species occurrence to provide a foundation for the development of predictive human-inclusive ecosystem models for the Paciﬁc Arctic region. We suggest that the {AMP} model, with its focus on phenology, might facilitate communication between conventional science approaches to marine research and seasonal-cycle based indigenous knowledge of marine ecosystems. The goal of improving our understanding of the state and variability of the Paciﬁc Arctic marine ecosystem is a shared one and we conclude with views on how the {AMP} model can support that goal while contributing to the development of a pan-Arctic ecosystem model.},

	abstract = {Variation in water temperature can have important eﬀects on the energetics underlying metabolism, growth, and reproduction of many organisms. In order to anticipate how a species' allocation of energy may change in a warming ocean, we need to know the degree to which processes such as metabolic rate change with temperature (i.e., the thermal sensitivity of metabolism, Q10). In the context of long-term climate change, it will also be helpful to know whether local populations that experience diﬀerent thermal regimes exhibit diﬀerences in thermal sensitivity. If so, it would indicate that thermal sensitivities of populations may adjust via acclimation or adaptation. We measured metabolic rates of Woolly Sculpin collected from two distant populations (Santa Cruz ({SC}) and Los Angeles ({LA}) counties, California, {USA}) and housed in a common environment. Using respirometry, we estimated resting mass-speciﬁc oxygen consumption ({MO}2) and calculated metabolic rates ({MR}) at temperatures of 12 °C, 16 °C, and 20 °C for 59 ﬁsh. The Q10 value across this range of temperatures was 2.92. Populations did not diﬀer with respect to overall {MO}2, nor did they vary in their degree of thermal sensitivity. However, the {LA} population had greater variation in {MO}2 among individuals when compared to the {SC} population. Larger variation in overall {MO}2 among individuals within speciﬁc populations may reﬂect greater genetic diversity, and this may buﬀer some populations against the eﬀect of future increases in water temperature.},

	abstract = {Ongoing climate change has led to an increase in sea surface temperatures of 2–4uC on the west coast of Greenland. Since fish are ectothermic, metabolic rate increases with ambient temperature. This makes these animals particularly sensitive to changes in temperature; subsequently any change may influence their metabolic scope, i.e. the physiological capacity to undertake aerobically challenging activities. Any temperature increase may thus disrupt species-specific temperature adaptations, at both the molecular level as well as in behavior, and concomitant species differences in the temperature sensitivity may shift the competitive balance among coexisting species. We investigated the influence of temperature on metabolic scope and competitive ability in three species of marine sculpin that coexist in Greenland coastal waters. Since these species have different distribution ranges, we hypothesized that there should be a difference in their physiological response to temperature; hence we compared their metabolic scope at three temperatures (4, 9 and 14uC). Their competitive ability at the ambient temperature of 9uC was also tested in an attempt to link physiological capacity with behaviour. The Arctic staghorn sculpin, the species with the northernmost distribution range, had a lower metabolic scope in the higher temperature range compared to the other two species, which had similar metabolic scope at the three temperatures. The Arctic staghorn sculpin also had reduced competitive ability at 9uC and may thus already be negatively affected by the current ocean warming. Our results suggest that climate change can have effects on fish physiology and interspecific competition, which may alter the species composition of the Arctic fish fauna.},

Here, we quantified when and where full-depth ({\textgreater} 20 m), solar-mediated {DVM} exists on a pan-Arctic scale. We observed the scattering population, most likely to be comprised of zooplankton, using 300 {kHz} acoustic Doppler current profilers ({ADCPs}). We quantified the presence/absence of {DVM}, and found that {DVM} continues throughout the year to at least 20 m at all locations south of 74° N. North of 77° N, {DVM} ceases for a period of time during the polar night. The dates of this cessation accurately align with the date of the winter solstice (± 2 d). Between 74 and 77° N, {DVM} presence/absence is variable. Acoustic data sampled at 89° N, however, showed no evidence of {DVM} at any time during the year — a new observation. Using indicators of presence/absence of sea ice from {ADCPs} and satellite-derived sea ice concentration data, we revealed that local variations in sea ice cover directly determine the continuation or cessation of {DVM} during the polar night. Earlier-forming and higher-concentration sea ice causes a cessation in {DVM}, whereas low-concentration or late-forming sea ice results in continuous {DVM} when comparing migrations at similar latitudes.},

	abstract = {Variation in water temperature can have important eﬀects on the energetics underlying metabolism, growth, and reproduction of many organisms. In order to anticipate how a species' allocation of energy may change in a warming ocean, we need to know the degree to which processes such as metabolic rate change with temperature (i.e., the thermal sensitivity of metabolism, Q10). In the context of long-term climate change, it will also be helpful to know whether local populations that experience diﬀerent thermal regimes exhibit diﬀerences in thermal sensitivity. If so, it would indicate that thermal sensitivities of populations may adjust via acclimation or adaptation. We measured metabolic rates of Woolly Sculpin collected from two distant populations (Santa Cruz ({SC}) and Los Angeles ({LA}) counties, California, {USA}) and housed in a common environment. Using respirometry, we estimated resting mass-speciﬁc oxygen consumption ({MO}2) and calculated metabolic rates ({MR}) at temperatures of 12 °C, 16 °C, and 20 °C for 59 ﬁsh. The Q10 value across this range of temperatures was 2.92. Populations did not diﬀer with respect to overall {MO}2, nor did they vary in their degree of thermal sensitivity. However, the {LA} population had greater variation in {MO}2 among individuals when compared to the {SC} population. Larger variation in overall {MO}2 among individuals within speciﬁc populations may reﬂect greater genetic diversity, and this may buﬀer some populations against the eﬀect of future increases in water temperature.},

Understanding the underlying mechanisms which produce inverted biomass pyramids provides new ecological insights. Some ecologists hypothesize that “the high growth rate of prey and low death rate of predators” causes {IBPs}. However, we show this is not always the case (see Sections 3.1 and 4). We devise predator–prey models to describe three mechanisms that can lead to {IBPs}: (1) well-mixed populations with large prey turn-over rate, (2) well-mixed populations with prey immigration, and (3) non-mixed populations where the prey can hide in refuges. The three models are motivated by the three ecosystems where {IBPs} have been observed. We also devise three refuge mediated models, with explicit refuge size, which incorporate different prey responses in the refuge, and we discuss how these lead to {IBPs}.},

We examined the trophic niche space for prey resources predicted from the isotopic ratios of fish collected in the coastal Beaufort and Chukchi Seas using several published Arctic marine {TDFs}. The different predictions were compared to highlight the implications of selecting appropriate {TDFs} in Arctic marine food web models. Predicted trophic niche space of prey resources differed greatly depending on the {TDFs} used, and the most appropriate {TDFs} from those that are currently available were identified for modeling Arctic nearshore lower trophic levels.},

Through meta-analysis, we determine narrowing discrimination from an empirical linear relationship between experimental Δ15N and δ15N values of prey consumed. The resulting scaled Δ15N framework estimated reliable {TPs} of zooplanktivores to tertiary piscivores congruent with known feeding relationships that radically alters the conventional structure of marine food webs. Apex predator {TP} estimates were markedly higher than currently assumed by whole-ecosystem models, indicating perceived food webs have been truncated and species-interactions over simplified.

Long chain omega-3 fatty acids, a subgroup of polyunsaturated fatty acids ({PUFAs}) produced exclusively by these algae, are essential to all marine organisms for successful reproduction, growth, and development. During an extensive field study in the Arctic shelf seas, we followed the seasonal biomass development of ice algae and phytoplankton and their food quality in terms of their relative {PUFA} content. The first {PUFA}-peak occurred in late April during solid ice cover at the onset of the ice algal bloom, and the second {PUFA}-peak occurred in early July just after the ice break-up at the onset of the phytoplankton bloom. The reproduction and growth of the key Arctic grazer Calanus glacialis perfectly coincided with these two bloom events. Females of C. glacialis utilized the high-quality ice algal bloom to fuel early maturation and reproduction, whereas the resulting offspring had access to ample high-quality food during the phytoplankton bloom 2 months later. Reduction in sea ice thickness and coverage area will alter the current primary production regime due to earlier ice break-up and onset of the phytoplankton bloom. A potential mismatch between the two primary production peaks of high-quality food and the reproductive cycle of key Arctic grazers may have negative consequences for the entire lipid-driven Arctic marine ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem modelling is a useful tool for exploring the potential outcomes of policy options and conducting experiments that would otherwise be impractical in the real world. However, ecosystem models have been limited in their ability to engage in the management of living marine resources due in part to high levels of uncertainty in model parameters and model outputs. Additionally, for multispecies or food web models, there is uncertainty about the predator-prey functional response, which can have implications for population dynamics. In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of large marine food webs in Alaska to parameter uncertainty, including parameters that govern the predator-prey functional response. We use Rpath, an R implementation of the food web modeling program Ecopath with Ecosim ({EwE}), to conduct a series of mortality-based perturbations to examine the sensitivity and recovery time of higher trophic level groups in the eastern Chukchi Sea, eastern Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska. We use a Monte Carlo approach to generate thousands of plausible ecosystems by drawing parameter sets from the range of uncertainty around the base model parameters. We subjected the ecosystem ensembles to a series of mortality-based perturbations to identify which functional groups the higher trophic level groups are most sensitive to when their mortality was increased, whether the food webs returned to their unperturbed configurations following a perturbation, and how long it took to return to that state. In all three ecosystems, we found that the number of disrupted ensemble food webs was positively related to the biomass and the number of trophic links of the perturbed functional group, and negatively related to trophic level. The eastern Chukchi Sea was most sensitive to perturbations to benthic invertebrate groups, the eastern Bering Sea was most sensitive to shrimp and walleye pollock, and the Gulf of Alaska was most sensitive to shrimps, pelagic forage fish, and zooplankton. Recovery time to perturbations were generally less than 5 years in all three ecosystems. The recovery times when fish groups were perturbed were generally longer than when benthic invertebrates were perturbed, and recovery times were shortest when it was pelagic invertebrates. The single model ensemble approach produced simulation results that described a range of possible outcomes to the prescribed perturbations and provided a sense for how robust the results are to parameter uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Reductions in Arctic sea ice affect marine food webs through a multitude of direct and indirect effects. We here analysed direct, indirect, and delayed associations between winter sea ice cover and year-to-year changes in biomasses of the main zooplankton groups (copepods, krill, amphipods) and planktivorous ﬁshes (capelin, polar cod) in the central and northern Barents Sea from 1980 to 2015. Climate effects and species interactions were estimated jointly in a Bayesian state-space model framework. We found that population biomass of capelin increased in years with low sea ice cover, while biomasses of copepods and amphipods decreased. Furthermore, results suggested strong bottom-up effects by krill on capelin and by copepods on amphipods and top-down effects by polar cod on amphipods and by capelin on krill and copepods. Sea ice effects thereby cascaded through the food web through indirect and delayed effects. The indirect and delayed effects ampliﬁed the effects of sea ice cover on capelin, copepods and amphipods. For krill, low sea ice cover most likely increased biomass in the short-term but reduced biomass in longer terms because of increased predation pressure. These ﬁndings suggest that both bottom-up and top-down processes need to be considered when projecting effects of future climate change on ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The earth is warming at an alarming rate, especially in the Arctic, where a marked decline in sea ice cover may have far-ranging consequences for endemic species. Little auks, endemic Arctic seabirds, are key bioindicators as they forage in the marginal ice zone and feed preferentially on lipid-rich Arctic copepods and ice-associated amphipods sensitive to the consequences of global warming. We tested how little auks cope with an ice-free foraging environment during the breeding season. To this end, we took advantage of natural variation in sea ice concentration along the east coast of Greenland. We compared foraging and diving behaviour, chick diet and growth and adult body condition between two years, in the presence versus nearby absence of sea ice in the vicinity of their breeding site. Moreover, we sampled zooplankton at sea when sea ice was absent to evaluate prey location and little auk dietary preferences. Little auks foraged in the same areas both years, irrespective of sea ice presence/concentration, and targeted the shelf break and the continental shelf. We confirmed that breeding little auks showed a clear preference for larger copepod species to feed their chick, but caught smaller copepods and nearly no ice-associated amphipod when sea ice was absent. Nevertheless, these dietary changes had no impact on chick growth and adult body condition. Our findings demonstrate the importance of bathymetry for profitable little auk foraging, whatever the sea-ice conditions. Our investigations, along with recent studies, also confirm more flexibility than previously predicted for this key species in a warming Arctic.},

	abstract = {Seabird foraging behaviour can reflect prey abundance at sea, and is influenced by stress hormone levels, thus providing a potential indicator of at-sea conditions. Using common diving petrels (Pelecanoides urinatrix, hereafter {CDPs}), a procellariform that preferentially forages on crustacean zooplankton, we sought to understand how spatially separate colonies responded behaviourally and physiologically to contrasting prey levels with a view to recruiting this species as an environmental indicator. In 2016, incubating {CDPs} from Tiritiri Matangi (− 36.59S; 174.88E, low levels of preferred prey) and Burgess (− 35.91S; 174.12E, high levels of preferred prey) Islands within the Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, were tracked using {GPS} devices. We hypothesised that Tiritiri birds would exhibit greater foraging effort and higher stress hormone levels across the breeding season due to lower levels of available prey. Hidden Markov methods were used to model foraging effort, and prey trophic level (stable isotopes: δ13C and δ15N) and stress hormone levels ({CORT}) quantified in plasma samples. During incubation birds were spatially segregated when foraging. Tiritiri birds exerted more effort, chasing higher trophic level prey at larger distances from the colony, and had higher body weight and lower {CORT} than Burgess birds. However, bird {CORT} levels responded more to reproductive duties (peaking during chick rearing) as opposed to colony location, i.e. {CORT} was not consistently higher in Tiritiri birds. Although a snapshot, our findings illustrate the promise of integrating multiple parameters when recruiting seabirds as ocean indicators, resulting in improved resolution of future monitoring programmes based upon them.},

	abstract = {The Marginal Ice Zone ({MIZ}) of the Arctic Ocean is changing rapidly due to a warming Arctic climate with commensurate reductions in sea ice extent and thickness. This Pan-Arctic review summarizes the main changes in the Arctic ocean–sea ice–atmosphere ({OSA}) interface, with implications for primary- and secondary producers in the ice and the underlying water column. Changes in the Arctic {MIZ} were interpreted for the period 1979–2010, based on best-ﬁt regressions for each month. Trends of increasingly open water were statistically signiﬁcant for each month, with quadratic ﬁt for August–November, illustrating particularly strong seasonal feedbacks in sea-ice formation and decay. Geographic interpretations of physical and biological changes were based on comparison of regions with signiﬁcant changes in sea ice: (1) The Paciﬁc Sector of the Arctic Ocean including the Canada Basin and the Beaufort, Chukchi and East Siberian seas; (2) The Canadian Arctic Archipelago; (3) Bafﬁn Bay and Hudson Bay; and (4) the Barents and Kara seas. Changes in ice conditions in the Barents sea/Kara sea region appear to be primarily forced by ocean heat ﬂuxes during winter, whereas changes in the other sectors appear to be more summer–autumn related and primarily atmospherically forced. Effects of seasonal and regional changes in {OSA}-system with regard to increased open water were summarized for photosynthetically available radiation, nutrient delivery to the euphotic zone, primary production of ice algae and phytoplankton, ice-associated fauna and zooplankton, and gas exchange of {CO}2. Changes in the physical factors varied amongst regions, and showed direct effects on organisms linked to sea ice. Zooplankton species appear to be more ﬂexible and likely able to adapt to variability in the onset of primary production. The major changes identiﬁed for the ice-associated ecosystem are with regard to production timing and abundance or biomass of ice ﬂora and fauna, which are related to regional changes in sea-ice conditions.},

Ice-associated fauna play a key role in this context because they constitute a unique part of Arctic biodiversity and transmit carbon from sea-ice algae into pelagic and benthic food webs. Our study presents the first regional-scale record of under-ice faunal distribution and the environmental characteristics of under-ice habitats throughout the Eurasian Basin. Sampling was conducted with a Surface and Under-Ice Trawl, equipped with a sensor array recording ice thickness and other physical parameters during trawling. We identified 2 environmental regimes, broadly coherent with the Nansen and Amundsen Basins. The Nansen Basin regime was distinguished from the Amundsen Basin regime by heavier sea-ice conditions, higher surface salinities and higher nitrate + nitrite concentrations. We found a diverse (28 species) under-ice community throughout the Eurasian Basin. Change in community structure reflected differences in the relative contribution of abundant species. Copepods (Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis) dominated in the Nansen Basin regime. In the Amundsen Basin regime, amphipods (Apherusa glacialis, Themisto libellula) dominated. Polar cod Boreogadus saida was present throughout the sampling area. Abrupt changes from a dominance of ice-associated amphipods at ice-covered stations to a dominance of pelagic amphipods (T. libellula) at nearby ice-free stations emphasised the decisive influence of sea ice on small-scale patterns in the surface-layer community. The observed response in community composition to different environmental regimes indicates potential long-term alterations in Arctic marine ecosystems as the Arctic Ocean continues to change.},

We present the first attempt to collect detailed (5 min/fix) movement trajectories of Common Diving Petrels, using miniaturised global positioning system ({GPS}) loggers. Adult breeding Common Diving Petrels were tracked for single foraging trips from Tiritiri Matangi Island near Auckland, New Zealand. We applied a hidden Markov model to infer behavioural states from the movement data, and a kernel density estimation on the {GPS} fixes of area-restricted behaviour to characterise feeding hotspots. We found that Common Diving Petrels in the Hauraki Gulf are local foragers during their breeding season, and the model results indicated that foraging accounted for two-thirds of all behaviour states. At-sea foraging activities of the birds were concentrated in areas up to 30 km from their colony. Our findings reveal the utility of combining {GPS} tracking with behavioural models to infer the foraging behaviours and space-use patterns of small seabird taxa.},

We examined the relative importance of each factor and how relative importance changes with season. Size increased with depth during both seasons for G. morhua and for M. aeglefinus during the fall, but decreased with depth for M. aeglefinus during the spring. Haddock size class distributions in the spring were also related to bottom temperature, with smaller individuals generally occurring in the warmest waters. For S. acanthias, depth was also the primary environmental variable explaining size class distributions in the fall, although size decreased with depth for this species. In the spring, bottom temperature was more important for spiny dogfish with smaller individuals associated with warmer bottom waters. Similarly, bottom temperature had the most explanatory value for M. bilinearis during both seasons, with size increasing with temperature. Seasonal associations with depth and temperature are related to spawning migrations, thermal preferences and other ecological factors. Timeblock accounted for a notable amount of variance, particularly for S. acanthias and M. bilinearis, and was reflective of how population size structure has responded to exploitation over the time series. The local-scale relationships between abundance and substrate previously established for some species were not strong at the broader spatial scale we examined. Understanding how habitat associations change with ontogeny will aid in refining spatial fisheries management approaches and in delineating essential fish habitat.},

Larvae collected from Western Bank, Scotian Shelf, in September, October, and November 1997 defined three monthly cohorts identified using inferred hatch dates. Total length-at-age relations did not differ between the September and October cohorts despite substantial differences in growing degree-day (435 versus 318°C·d) and zooplankton (potential prey index) wet biomass (0.15 versus 0.27 g·m–3). Larvae collected off-bank in September exhibited a growth advantage of {\textgreater}0.10 mm·d–1 relative to larvae collected on-bank. Greater variability in growth rate within cohorts and among water masses implies that cohortaveraged growth and survival (based on growth) estimates can be biased by overrepresentation of a single water mass. The focus on growth variability, and its relationship to survival, should be on individuals within cohorts and not on cohort-averaged estimates. We hypothesize that growth, and perhaps survival, in silver hake larvae on the Scotian Shelf is most easily explained by variation in physical oceanographic processes.},

	abstract = {We determined the hatch dates of young-of-year ({YOY}) juveniles from the 1995 to 1999 year-classes of haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus collected in the Northeast Fisheries Science Center fall groundfish surveys in the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank region. Hatch dates were based on age estimates made by counting otolith daily rings. The average {YOY} haddock was {\textgreater} 200 d old at the time of capture, with estimated hatch dates ranging from mid November to early June. Haddock collected in the Gulf of Maine had mean hatch dates about 1 mo later than fish collected on Georges Bank. Each year on Georges Bank, hatch date frequencies ({HDF}) of survivors peaked between February and mid March, considerably earlier than the peak in {HDF} estimated from late-stage eggs. The ratio of the relative {HDF} of survivors collected in the fall to the relative {HDF} estimated from late-stage eggs was used to calculate relative survivorship of different cohorts. These data suggest that haddock hatched early in the season had a survival advantage over those hatched later in the year. The 1998 year-class, the largest produced on Georges Bank in the past 20 yr, had one of the latest peaks in {HDF} of juveniles among the 5 years examined. More survivors were produced in each month of 1998 compared to the monthly averages of the remaining years. In particular, the 1998 year-class benefited from enhanced survival of individuals hatched in the mid and latter portions of the hatch curve, although survival was still highest for individuals originating from the early portion of the hatching curve.},

We used logistic generalized additive models to characterize the average ingress, peak, and egress timing of spawning. In the 2010s, alewife arrived to spawning habitat 16 days earlier and egressed 27 days earlier (peak 12 days earlier) relative to the 1970s. Blueback herring arrived 5 days earlier and egressed 23 days earlier (peak 13 days earlier) in the 2010s relative to the 1980s. The changes in ingress and egress timing have shortened the occurrence in spawning systems by 11 days for alewife over four decades and 18 days for blueback herring over three decades. We found that the rate of vernal warming was faster during 2001–2016 relative to 1973–1988 and is the most parsimonious explanation for changes in spawning phenology. The inﬂuence of a shortened spawning season on river herring population dynamics warrants further investigation.},

River herring are currently under moratoria in the Potomac River because of a lack of information about their populations. Ages determined from the use of otoliths and scales collected from river herring were compared to quantify aging bias and precision. For 2- and 3-year-old individuals, ages were commonly higher when derived from scales than when derived from otoliths. Length-at-age data were analyzed by using 9 growth models, and the best-fit-model was determined by using Akaike’s information criterion ({AIC}). The outputs from the growth models were only slightly different, with differences of 10.6\% and 10.5\% in the {AIC} weights between best- and worst-fit models for alewife and blueback herring, respectively. Results from the use of a von Bertalanffy growth model indicate that alewife grew larger and faster than blueback herring (P{\textless}0.0001) and that females grew larger and faster than males for both species (P{\textless}0.0001). The findings of this study provide needed aging and growth information about 2 species within the Potomac River, where information about growth rates and population ages is limited.},

	abstract = {Three species of the stromateoid genus Peprilus have been found to occur in the northwest Atlantic: P. triacanthus Ibutterfishl, P. burti (gulf butterfish), and P. alepidotus (harvestfish). Peprilus triacanthus and P. alepidotus reportedly spawn from May through August and June through July. respectively. Peprilus burti spawns twice yearly: February through May and September through November. Collections oflarvae and juveniles {ofPeprilus} spp. from the northern South Atlantic ({SAB}) and Mid-Atlantic ({MAB}) Bights during both the spring and summer of 1988 and 1989 suggest that either a combination of species was spawning or that reported spawning dates were suspect. Species identification of Peprilus in these collections was determined with morphometric, meristic, and pigment character analyses. Specimens sampled had counts for caudal vertebrae (18-19) and ventral midline melanophores (11-16) consistent with those found for P. triacanthus in previous studies. By analyzing otoliths, we estimated larval and juvenile growth rates to be approximately 0.23 mmlday. Backcalculation ofhatch dates suggests either two spawning events for P. triacanthus, February through {midApril} and mid-May through late July, or one extended spawning period beginning in late February and ending in late July. This study reveals that P. triacanthus spawns for a much longer period than previously thought. It is possible that P. triacanthus spawns during the spring in the {SAB} and summer in the {MAB} as a strategy to extend the duration ofits spawning period. This strategy is one used by other north-south migrating species and warrants further study.},

Even though several year classes are present, there is little evidence of white hake reproduction occurring along the northern coastal shelf. Based on survey indices of early life history stages, researchers concluded that they reproduced at one of the two population centers located either from the Scotian Shelf area in eastern {GOM} or from the Georges Bank-Mid Atlantic Bight area. White hake have been absent from large areas of the {GOM} for more than 15 years and this suggests substantive changes may have occurred in their distribution since the 1920s. Various factors may have contributed to this observation, including the loss of spawning aggregations. This study examined the historical population structure of white hake in the Gulf during the 1920s, a period when stocks were more abundant. Their seasonal distribution, movement patterns and the behavior of individual population components were derived from relevant scientiﬁc literature and surveys of ﬁshermen gathered during the period. The study identiﬁed several resident groups of white hake near the coastal shelf that displayed cyclic movement patterns to ﬁshing grounds that have been abandoned for decades. The comparison of historical distribution patterns to recent white hake surveys revealed the loss of resident white hake groups from grounds bordering the northern {GOM} coastal shelf that apparently were undetected spawning components. Signiﬁcance of the predator–prey linkage with alewives is discussed.},

A brief description of the fishery is provided. Silver hake of the area form a self-reproducing group, geographically separated from more southwesterly stocks. They distribute demersally for the most part of the year and form aggregations mainly in deep-water depressions of the shelf and warm slope waters. Silver hake may be classified as a species with a high rate of renewal and of pronounced abundance fluctuations in response to climatic variations. The effect of any stock-recruitment relationship is over-shadowed by the impact of oceanographic factors within a wide range of spawning biomass. This paper makes an attempt to predict the trends of abundance of the silver hake population in the late-1990s and the first decade of the next century. While sharp variations of year-class abundance are caused by environmental variability, it is suggested that during this period, favourable conditions are expected for formation of relatively strong year-classes and, therefore, for good fishing.},

	abstract = {Background:  Acoustic telemetry is a commonly used tool to gain knowledge about aquatic animal ecology through the study of their movements. In telemetry studies researchers must make inferences regarding the movements and the fates of tagged animals. Until recently, predation has been inferred in telemetry data using a variety of methods including abrupt changes in movement patterns or habitat use. An acoustic telemetry transmitter has been developed to detect predation events of tagged animals, and while they have performed well in controlled laboratory trials, literature regarding the application of these novel transmitters in field settings is limited. The objective of this research was to describe the detection data obtained from field studies using predation tags and propose methods to incorporate this information in decision-making about the fate of tagged animals. We implanted 60 yellow perch (Perca flavescens) with predation transmitters and evaluated their spatial use in a receiver array (34 ha) using a combination of centres of activity, roaming indices, and step length measures to examine detection data.
Results:  Over 5 months, 19 apparent predation events were identified by the transmitters. Roaming indices and centres of activity revealed a variety of detection patterns, including instances of altered behaviour before and after predation that matched tag-indentified predation events, dropped tags post-predation, and detections that ceased post-predation indicating the predator might have left the array. Based on the observed patterns, probable predation was inferred for 15 of 19 triggered tags, with unclear fates for four fish.
Conclusions:  Our study provided a framework to assess the fate of animals tagged with predation transmitters and demonstrate how these tags can contribute to telemetry studies. We showed how detections can be categorized using tag status to compare movement metrics among individuals, provided tools to explore space use surrounding predation events, and synthesized this information to inform uncertainty surrounding tag-identified predation events. Predation tags do not remove all uncertainty about the fate of tagged individuals, but combined with other metrics they increase the likelihood of identifying abnormal movements that could otherwise introduce biased detection histories into studies of small-sized fishes.},

	abstract = {A land process model [the coupled hydrological and biogeochemical model ({CHANGE})] is used to quantitatively assess changes in the ice phenology, thickness, and volume of terrestrial Arctic rivers from 1979 to 2009. The {CHANGE} model was coupled with a river routing and discharge model enabling explicit representation of river ice and water temperature dynamics. Model-simulated river ice phenological dates and thickness were generally consistent with in situ river ice data and landscape freeze–thaw ({FT}) satellite observations. Climate data indicated an increasing trend in winter surface air temperature ({SAT}) over the pan-Arctic during the study period. Nevertheless, the river ice thickness simulations exhibited a thickening regional trend independent of {SAT} warming, and associated with less insulation and cooling of underlying river ice by thinning snow cover. Deeper snow depth ({SND}) combined with {SAT} warming decreased simulated ice thickness, especially for Siberian rivers, where ice thickness is more strongly correlated with {SND} than {SAT}. Overall, the Arctic river ice simulations indicated regional trends toward later fall freezeup, earlier spring breakup, and consequently a longer annual ice-free period. The simulated ice phenological dates were signiﬁcantly correlated with seasonal {SAT} warming. It is found that {SND} is an important factor for winter river ice growth, while ice phenological timing is dominated by seasonal {SAT}. The mean total Arctic river ice volume simulated from {CHANGE} was 54.1 km3 based on the annual maximum ice thickness in individual grid cells, while river ice volume for the pan-Arctic rivers decreased by 2.82 km3 (0.5\%) over the 1979–2009 record. Arctic river ice is shrinking as a consequence of regional climate warming and coincident with other cryospheric components, including permafrost, glaciers, and sea ice.},

              experiments suggest that extrapolation of the temperature dependency of small fish to larger fish, as is commonly done, may misrepresent potential growth at higher temperatures. Independent model validation using laboratory experiments found consumption estimates (from growth) to be within −1.4 to +4.5\% of known values for all species at temperatures above 19 °C; however, at 6.9°C consumption by striped bass was overestimated by 20–46\%. Model estimates of growth (from consumption) were within −7.1 to +30.1\% of known values in all validations. Overall, the growth physiology of the three species appeared to be related to the water temperatures encountered during estuarine residency and production.},

	abstract = {We have developed a habitat selection model based on central place foraging theory. An individual’s decision to include a patch in its habitat depends on the marginal fitness contribution of that patch, which is characterized by its quality and distance to the central place. The essence of the model we have developed is a fitness isocline which is a function of patch quality and travel time to the patch. It has two parameters: the maximum travel distance to a patch of infinite quality and a coefficient that appropriately scales quality by travel time. Patches falling below the isocline will have positive marginal fitness values and should be included in the habitat. The maximum travel distance depends on the availability and quality of patches, as well as on the forager’s life history, whereas the scaling parameter mostly depends on life history properties. Using the model, we derived a landscape quality metric (which can be thought of as a connectivity measure) that sums the values of available habitat in the landscape around a central place. We then fitted the two parameters to foraging data on breeding white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and estimated landscape quality, which correlated strongly with reproductive success.},

	abstract = {During reproduction, seabirds need to balance the demands of self- and offspringprovisioning within the constraints imposed by central place foraging. To assess behavioral adjustments and tolerances to these constraints, we studied the feeding tactics and reproductive success of common murres (also known as common guillemots) Uria aalge, at their largest and most offshore colony (Funk Island) where parents travel long distances to deliver a single capelin Mallotus villosus to their chicks. We assessed changes in the distance murres traveled from the colony, their proximate foraging locations and prey size choice during two successive years in which capelin exhibited an order of magnitude decrease in density and a shift from aggregated (2004) to dispersed (2005) distributions. When capelin availability was low (2005), parental murres increased their maximum foraging distances by 35\% (60 to 81 km) and delivered signiﬁcantly larger capelin to chicks, as predicted by central place foraging theory. Murres preferred large (4140 mm) relative to small capelin (100–140 mm) in both years, but unexpectedly this preference increased as the relative density of large capelin decreased. We conclude that single prey-loading murres target larger capelin during long foraging trips as parents are ‘forced’ to select the best prey for their offspring. Low ﬂedgling masses suggest also that increased foraging time when capelin is scarce may come at a cost to the chicks (i.e. fewer meals per day). Murres at this colony may be functioning near physiological limits above which further or sustained adjustments in foraging effort could compromise the life-time reproductive success of this long-lived seabird.},

Dietary overlap was high, 0.812. Fish comprised over 96\% of the prey delivered (frequency) to Common Tern chicks. In contrast, Arctic Tern chicks were fed a diet consisting of 65\% fish and 35\% invertebrates. Although the two terns fed different proportions of fish, both species relied heavily on white hake (Urophycis tenuis), Four-bearded rockling (Enchelyopus cimbrius) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus). American sand lance (Ammodytes americanus) was an important prey for Common Terns at one island. Overall, Common Terns fed their young a greater diversity of prey than did Arctic Terns. We found significant inter-annual and inter-colony differences in the diversity and proportions of prey types. "Boom and bust" years were evident for particular prey. We suspect dietary differences in Maine were due to colony location; however, a detailed study of the relationship between prey availability and abundance and the foraging ecology of terns in Maine is needed to elucidate these relationships. We believe long-term diet data sets gathered from multiple sites are the best way to characterize waterbird diets.},

Gobies are potential vectors for material transfer between the benthic and pelagic zones. A bioenergetics model was developed for round gobies to enable us to quantify the flow of energy, contaminants, and nutrients from the benthos to pelagic fishes. Weight- and temperature-dependent coefficients for metabolism and consumption were derived. Food consumption increased with temperature up to 26°C before sharply decreasing, and weight-specific consumption decreased with increasing fish weight (allometric coefficient = –0.256, {SE} = 0.160). Specific oxygen consumption was inversely related to body mass (allometric coefficient = –0.157, {SE} = 0.025) and increased exponentially with temperature. Estimated Q10 for respiration was 1.84. Additional parameters were obtained from the literature to describe specific dynamic action, egestion, excretion, and reproductive losses. The bioenergetics model explained growth of round gobies in Lake Erie and in their native range.},

	abstract = {Climate change is having profound impacts on Arctic ecosystems with important implications for coastal productivity and food web dynamics. We investigated seasonal variations in resource use of 16 invertebrate taxa in lagoon ecosystems along the Alaska Beaufort Sea coast using a combination of fatty acid ({FA}) biomarkers, bulk stable carbon isotope measurements of whole animals, and compound-specific stable carbon isotope measurements of total lipid extracts and individual {FAs}. Invertebrates were collected during full-ice cover (April), ice breakup (June), and open water (August) periods. Amphipods (Onisimus glacialis) had higher proportions of 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 {FAs} in April than in the other months. These elevated markers were accompanied by relatively low bulk and 18:2n-6 δ13C values, indicating proportionally higher contributions from terrestrial/freshwater sources in April. A wider range of invertebrates examined during June and August showed increases in algae-specific markers and higher proportions of essential {FAs} (e.g., 22:6n-3 [docosahexaenoic acid] and 20:5n-3 [eicosapentaenoic acid]) later in the summer. There were also marked differences in {FA} characteristics among invertebrates that highlighted differential feeding modes. For example, proportions of bacterial {FAs} were generally higher in deposit-feeding invertebrates than in suspension feeders. These results highlight the current role of diverse carbon sources to Arctic coastal food webs, which may change with future warming.},

	abstract = {Sea ice algae have been widely discussed as a potential food source for pelagic and benthic animals in ice-covered waters, specifically in the light of current substantial changes in the Arctic ice regime. Stomach and gut contents of the Arctic nearshore lysianassid amphipod Onisimus litoralis sampled from February to May 2003 indicate that Arctic ice algae were dominant food no earlier than the onset of ice melt. Crustaceans, common prey in a previous study, were absent in stomachs and guts during the survey period. Our data support the concept that sea ice—derived organic carbon is of specific relevance for Arctic plankton and benthos during the period of ice melt. On a souvent discuté du fait que les algues de glace de mer pourraient être une source d'alimentation pour les animaux pélagiques et benthiques des eaux recouvertes de glace, surtout à la lumière des changements considérables qui caractérisent le régime de glaciation de l'Arctique. Le contenu de l'estomac et des intestins des amphipodes lysianassides Onisimus litoralis en proximité des rives de l'Arctique qui a été échantillonné de février à mai 2003 indique que les algues de glace de l'Arctique étaient dominantes pas plus tôt qu'au moment de la fonte des glaces. Les crustacés, qui étaient une proie courante dans le cadre d'une étude antérieure, ne se retrouvaient pas dans les estomacs et les intestins des animaux au cours de la période d'échantillonnage. Nos données viennent soutenir le concept selon lequel le carbone organique dérivé de la glace de mer revêt une importance particulière pour le plancton de l'Arctique et le benthos pendant la période de la fonte des glaces.},

The grazing impact on the ice-algal standing stock at the ice underside in summer, estimated for 2 different areas in the Arctic, was low (1.1\% d-' in the Laptev Sea, 2.6\% d-' in the Greenland Sea), indicating that food is not a limiting factor in this habitat.},

	volume = {310},
	abstract = {Food web structure and pathways from primary production were studied in pelagic, sympagic (ice-associated) and benthic communities during summer in a seasonally ice covered region of the northern Barents Sea. Stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) were used as tracers of organic material through marine food webs and trophic levels of organisms, respectively. Measurements of δ15N show that sympagic amphipods occupy the lowest trophic levels (ca. 2), for primary consumers, followed by zooplankton (2.0 to 2.6), benthic suspension and deposit feeders (2.2 to 3.7), benthic carnivores (3.6 to 4.4) and fishes (3.3 to 4.4). The δ13C values indicate that zooplankton mainly graze on suspended particulate organic material ({POM}). Sympagic amphipods derive most of their energy from ice {POM}, but some species had δ13C values indicating that phytoplankton also contributes to their energy intake. δ13C values of some components of the benthic community suggest that {POM} settling out of the water column is efficiently exploited by the benthic fauna. Elevated δ13C values of the benthic fauna relative to zooplankton at some stations indicate that the degree of pelagic–benthic coupling at stations separated by only 90 km is determined by a combination of factors, including water-mass properties and the primary-production regime. These results may qualify findings of previous studies that have sampled from discrete locations or have pooled specimens collected from a broad area to make conclusions about food webs on a regional scale.},

	abstract = {Rapid environmental changes occurring in the Arctic nearshore are expected to have significant effects on food web structures. Land-fast ice cover limits the effectiveness of monitoring methods during winter months, precluding understanding of how seasonal Arctic nearshore food webs operate. Tissue-dependent stable isotope analysis ({SIA}) offers an efficient and cost-effective approach to monitoring changes in food webs during icecovered months but requires controlled laboratory experiments to determine isotopic turnover rates and trophic discrimination factors ({TDFs}) of different tissues. We propose that Arctic Sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpioides) be used to investigate Arctic nearshore trophodynamics given its opportunistic feeding habits and consistent residence within nearshore Arctic habitats. We present the first tissue-dependent {SIA} experiment on an Arctic marine fish species and show that δ15N values of fin (or liver) and muscle of Arctic Sculpin may be used to identify shifts in low-trophic-level resource availability between 56 and 122 days before sacrifice. Furthermore, {TDFs} were determined for carbon isotopes (1.87‰), but results for nitrogen (1.23‰ to 3.23‰) suggest that {TDFs} in Arctic fish may be highly dependent on lipid content of their diet. We observed similar turnover rates between liver and fin tissues (56 and 58 days, respectively), and suggest it may not be necessary to sample both, making it possible to use Arctic Sculpin for tissue dependent analyses with potentially non-lethal sampling of fin and muscle tissues. The use of Arctic Sculpin as an indicator species can increase the understanding of food web structure and aid in monitoring changes to lower-trophic level prey availability as ecosystem dynamics are affected by climate change.},

	abstract = {Concerns regarding sentinel species for assessing environmental impacts include residency, abundance, and suitability for measuring responses, if effects are to be attributable to local conditions. Stable isotope analysis was used as a tool to investigate site fidelity of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) to establish residency and exposure for the sculpin. We predicted that sculpin collected from sites adjacent to agricultural activity would show higher δ15N values than those collected from sites in forested areas because of isotopic enrichment by fertilizers in the former. The predominant use of chemical fertilizer applications in the region, however, resulted in no specific enrichment of 15N in sculpin collected in the agricultural region. However, there was an incremental enrichment in the fish muscle tissue of approximately 5‰ in δ13C values in a downstream direction, irrespective of surrounding land use. As a result, the dual-isotope comparison was successful at demonstrating site-specific isotopic signatures across sites for 30 km of the river system. The site-specific signatures suggest that slimy sculpin are not moving considerable distances among sites and are incorporating their isotopic signatures over a narrow spatial scale. The results support the use of the slimy sculpin as a sentinel species for investigating site-specific environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {Recently, the use of small-bodied fish in environmental monitoring has increased, particularly within the Canadian environmental effects monitoring ({EEM}) and other adaptive programs. Although it is possible to measure changes with many small-bodied species, interpretation is often complicated by the absence of information on the biology and ecology of fish not of commercial, recreational, or traditional interest. Knowing and understanding the basic biology of these fishes aids in the sensitivity of study designs (i.e., ability to detect change) and the interpretation of all biological levels of responses (e.g., cellular to community). The increased use of slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus Richardson, 1836) in impact assessment studies in North America provides a considerable amount of information on life history aspects. The slimy sculpin has the most ubiquitous North American distribution among cottids but yet has a very small home range, thus integrating environmental conditions of localized areas. This paper describes aspects of slimy sculpin life cycle that affect collection efficiency and timing, and describes and provides data collected over more than 10 years of studies at more than 20 reference study sites. This overview provides a functional and informative compilation to support adaptive environmental monitoring and provide a baseline for comparative ecological study.},

This poses a significant challenge for the marine organisms associated with the Arctic sea ice, such as marine mammals and, not least, the ice-associated crustaceans generally considered to spend their entire life on the underside of the Arctic sea ice. Based upon unique samples collected within the Arctic Ocean during the polar night, we provide a new conceptual understanding of an intimate connection between these under-ice crustaceans and the deep Arctic Ocean currents. We suggest that downwards vertical migrations, followed by polewards transport in deep ocean currents, are an adaptive trait of ice fauna that both increases survival during ice-free periods of the year and enables re-colonization of sea ice when they ascend within the Arctic Ocean. From an evolutionary perspective, this may have been an adaptation allowing success in a seasonally ice-covered Arctic. Our findings may ultimately change the perception of ice fauna as a biota imminently threatened by the predicted disappearance of perennial sea ice.},

	abstract = {In many Appalachian headwater streams brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are the only ﬁsh species present. Land use practices or global warming can have a signiﬁcant effect on the production and survival of brook trout in these streams. Managers must be able to evaluate the potential impact of thermal changes upon these streams and bioenergetics models represent a valuable tool in this effort. Here we present a bioenergetics model for brook trout and conduct a laboratory validation of the model. Model validation experiments showed the model to adequately predict the growth, ﬁnal weight, and consumption of ﬁsh in the experiments. Growth and ﬁnal weight were estimated within –1.4\% (not signiﬁcantly different than 0) and consumption was slightly underestimated, within –19.7\% (Ϯ 7.5\%) of observed values. Scope for growth from the bioenergetics model suggests that given unlimited food, growth of brook trout may be possible over the range of environmental temperatures supporting brook trout. However, under more restricted rations typical of Appalachian headwater streams (20\% ad libitum) only modest growth is possible between 3.5 and 20C. These growth restrictions may have serious implications for thermal alterations upon Appalachian brook trout and may suggest that energetically, over winter may be a critical time for these ﬁsh.},

	abstract = {Although thermal inﬂuences on the physiology of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) have been widely studied, there is little information about the responses of different genetic strains to temperatures. The effects of water temperature (10, 14, 19, 22, and 25 ◦C) on food consumption rate, growth rate, gross conversion efﬁciency, resting routine oxygen consumption rate, upper critical thermal tolerance and critical swimming velocity were investigated in juvenile rainbow trout of the Eagle Lake (O. m. aquilarum) subspecies and the Mt. Shasta strain. No strain-related differences in conversion efﬁciency, oxygen consumption rates, thermal tolerance or swimming performance were observed in 1995 (19, 22, and 25 ◦C) or 1996 (10, 14, and 19 ◦C), but Mt. Shasta strain trout grew faster at highest temperatures than did Eagle Lake trout. Food consumption rates, growth rates, conversion efﬁciency, and oxygen consumption rates declined at the extreme temperatures (10 and 25 ◦C) in both Eagle Lake and Mt. Shasta trout. Swimming performance was temperature-independent between 10 and 19 ◦C (overall mean: 5.43 body lengths s−1).},

	abstract = {Shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) from Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, is a slow growing long-lived species. A wide range of diet items were present in the stomachs of the shorthorn sculpins sampled but 2-3 diet items (amphipod species) comprised 99.5 \% of total food consumed. These amphipods were present in the stomachs in similar proportions among all age classes of shorthorn sculpin. Several new host records for parasites were reported and mean numbers of parasite species increased with shorthorn sculpin age. The increased diversity of parasite species and higher δ15N values in older/larger individuals suggest that their diets were more diverse and the prey items consumed had higher δ15N values. By contrast, the value of δ13C in dominant diet items masked the δ13C values of minor diet items. We conclude that parasites and stable isotope values provide complementary data on feeding patterns of the shorthorn sculpin. The ubiquitous marine acanthocephalan, Echinorhynchus gadi, was found at high prevalences (87-100 \%) and mean intensities (28-35), and were localized in the midgut. In contrast to other studies on acanthocephalans, E. gadi did not influence fish condition as measured by condition factor, liver somatic and gonado-somatic indices.},

	abstract = {One consequence of climate change is an increasing mismatch between timing of food requirements and food availability. Such a mismatch is primarily expected in avian long-distance migrants because of their complex annual cycle, and in habitats with a seasonal food peak. Here we show that insectivorous long-distance migrant species in The Netherlands declined strongly (1984–2004) in forests, a habitat characterized by a short spring food peak, but that they did not decline in less seasonal marshes. Also, within generalist long-distance migrant species, populations declined more strongly in forests than in marshes. Forest-inhabiting migrant species arriving latest in spring declined most sharply, probably because their mismatch with the peak in food supply is greatest. Residents and short-distance migrants had non-declining populations in both habitats, suggesting that habitat quality did not deteriorate. Habitat-related differences in trends were most probably caused by climate change because at a European scale, long-distance migrants in forests declined more severely in western Europe, where springs have become considerably warmer, when compared with northern Europe, where temperatures during spring arrival and breeding have increased less. Our results suggest that trophic mismatches may have become a major cause for population declines in long-distance migrants in highly seasonal habitats.},

However, evaluation of extinction risk using conventional methods is diﬃcult for the majority of ﬁsh species because the population data normally required by such methods are unavailable. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system that integrates life history and ecological characteristics of marine ﬁshes to estimate their intrinsic vulnerability to ﬁshing. We extract heuristic rules (expressed in {IF}–{THEN} clauses) from published literature describing known relationships between biological characteristics and vulnerability. Input and output variables are deﬁned by fuzzy sets which deal explicitly with the uncertainty associated with qualitative knowledge. Conclusions from diﬀerent lines of evidence are combined through fuzzy inference and defuzziﬁcation processes. Our fuzzy system provides vulnerability estimates that correlate with observed declines more closely than previous methods, and has advantages in ﬂexibility of input data requirements, in the explicit representation of uncertainty, and in the ease of incorporating new knowledge. This fuzzy expert system can be used as a decision support tool in ﬁshery management and marine conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Selection of prey that are small and in poor body condition is a widespread phenomenon in terrestrial predator–prey systems and may benefit prey populations by removing substandard individuals. Similar selection is widely assumed to operate in aquatic systems. Indeed, size-­selective predation is a longstanding and central tenet of aquatic food web theory. However, it is not known if aquatic predators select prey based on their condition or state, compared to their size. Surprisingly, no comparable information is available for marine systems because it is exceedingly difficult to make direct observations in this realm. Thus the role of body condition in regulating susceptibility to predation remains a black box in the marine environment. Here we have exploited an ideal model system to evaluate selective predation on pelagic marine fish: comparing characteristics (fork length, mass corrected for fork length) of fresh, whole, intact juvenile Pacific salmon delivered by a seabird to its single nestling with salmon collected concurrently in coastal trawl surveys. Three species of juvenile salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are consumed by provisioning Rhinoceros Auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata); an abundant, colonial, pursuit-­ diving seabird. Samples were collected from multiple colonies and fisheries surveys in coastal British Columbia in two years. As predicted, Auklets preyed on small individuals in poor condition and consistently selected them at levels higher than their relative availability. This is the first study to provide direct evidence for both size-­and condition-s­ elective predation on marine fish in the wild. We anticipate that our results will be a starting point in evaluating how selective predation may structure or influence marine fish populations and bridges a fundamental incongruity between ecological theory and application; although “bigger is better” is considered a fundamental tenet of marine food webs, marine predators are often assumed to consume indiscriminately.},

	abstract = {Generalist seabirds forage on a variety of prey items providing the opportunity to monitor diverse aquatic fauna simultaneously. For example, the coupling of prey consumption rates and movement patterns of generalist seabirds might be used to create three-dimensional prey distribution maps (‘preyscapes’) for multiple prey species in the same region. However, the complex interaction between generalist seabird foraging behaviour and the various prey types clouds the interpretation of such preyscapes, and the mechanisms underlying prey selection need to be understood before such an application can be realized. Central place foraging theory provides a theoretical model for understanding such selectivity by predicting that larger prey items should be 1) selected farther from the colony and 2) for chick-feeding compared with self-feeding, but these predictions remain untested on most seabird species. Furthermore, rarely do we know how foraging features such as handling time, capture methods or choice of foraging location varies among prey types. We used three types of animal-borne biologgers (camera loggers, {GPS} and depth-loggers) to examine how a generalist Arctic seabird, the thick-billed murre Uria lomvia, selects and captures their prey throughout the breeding season. Murres captured small prey at all phases of a dive, including while descending and ascending, but captured large fish mostly while ascending, with considerably longer handling times. Birds captured larger prey and dove deeper during chick-rearing. As central place foraging theory predicted, birds travelling further also brought bigger prey items for their chick. The location of a dive (distance from colony and distance to shore) best explained which prey type was the most likely to get caught in a dive, and we created a preyscape surrounding our study colony. We discuss how these findings might aid the use of generalist seabirds as bioindicators.},

Nearshore ﬁsh and zooplankton communities were sampled in the summers of 2013–2015. Spatial, temporal, environmental, and biological drivers of ﬁsh community structure in the Arctic nearshore surrounding Point Barrow were investigated using multivariate canonical correspondence analysis ({CCA}). A {CCA} model using the 13 most explanatory variables (three environmental, one spatial, four temporal, and ﬁve zooplankton abundances) explained 73\% of the variance in community structure in this region. Distinct ﬁsh communities were identiﬁed within the three waterbodies that were studied (Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, and Elson Lagoon), and these distinctions were largely driven by salinity. Species move into the nearshore at various times after landfast ice breaks up, creating an annual succession of species that can be found in these nearshore habitats. Low-latitude species tend to become abundant later in the summer season, whereas true Arctic species are present under the ice or move in shortly after breakup. Arctic species are also more abundant in colder years, whereas low-latitude species dominate during warmer years. The increasing abundance of low-latitude species in the Arctic nearshore may have serious implications for the food webs in these ecosystems as climate change continues.},

In estuaries and rivers, accounting for the complex shape of water bodies is challenging. Current methods for analysing utilization distributions ({UDs}) are restricted to using the locations of receivers where animals have been detected, which limits the information available to estimate movement paths. We present a new r package ({RSP}—Refined Shortest Paths) for analysing the movements of animals tracked with acoustic transmitters in environments constrained by landmasses. The method estimates the shortest in water locations of monitored animals between pairs of detections using least-cost path analysis. It then applies dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models to calculate {UD} areas. Intra- and interspecific overlaps in space and time are calculated and can be used, for example, to investigate potential influencing environmental factors. Tracks refined with {RSP} follow the estuary shape, yielding substantially longer, but more realistic travel distances. Showcased examples demonstrate how {RSP} can be used to analyse intra- and interspecific movement patterns; determine similarities in habitat use; identify the environmental conditions responsible for influencing the size of the space use areas; and assess levels of spatial overlap between different species. The {RSP} toolkit generates more realistic movements of tracked animals than those derived using receiver locations alone. An incidental benefit is its ability to deal with receiver loss, a common problem in acoustic telemetry studies. The analysis can be readily customized to suit different study species, array configurations and habitat shapes.},

We review examples from across the animal kingdom to distill fundamental processes by which migratory animals influence communities and ecosystems, demonstrating that they can uniquely alter energy flow, food-web topology and stability, trophic cascades, and the structure of metacommunities. Given the potential for migration to alter ecological networks worldwide, we suggest an integrative framework through which community dynamics and ecosystem functioning may explicitly consider animal migrations.},

	abstract = {Interspecific patterns of fish life histories were evaluated in relation to several theoretical models of life-history evolution. Data were gathered for 216 North American fish species (57 families) to explore relationships among variables and to ordinate species. Multivariate tests, performed on freshwater, marine, and combined data matrices, repeatedly identified a gradient associating later-maturing fishes with higher fecundity, small eggs, and few bouts of reproduction during a short spawning season and the opposite suite of traits with small fishes. A second strong gradient indicated positive associations between parental care, egg size, and extended breeding seasons. Phylogeny affected each variable, and some higher taxonomic groupings were associated with particular life-history strategies. High-fecundity characteristics tended to be associated with large species ranges in the marine environment. Age at maturation, adult growth rate, life span, and egg size positively correlated with anadromy. Parental care was inversely correlated with median latitude. A trilateral continuum based on essential trade-offs among three demographic variables predicts many of the correlations among life-history traits. This framework has implications for predicting population responses to diverse natural and anthropogenic disturbances and provides a basis for comparing responses of different species to the same disturbance.},

A new generation of climate models can now provide estimates of future climate change, considering the biological feedbacks through the development of the coupled physical–ecosystem model. Here we present the geophysical impact of phytoplankton, which is often overlooked in future climate projections. A suite of future warming experiments using a fully coupled ocean−atmosphere model that interacts with a marine ecosystem model reveals that the future phytoplankton change influenced by greenhouse warming can amplify Arctic surface warming considerably. The warming-induced sea ice melting and the corresponding increase in shortwave radiation penetrating into the ocean both result in a longer phytoplankton growing season in the Arctic. In turn, the increase in Arctic phytoplankton warms the ocean surface layer through direct biological heating, triggering additional positive feedbacks in the Arctic, and consequently intensifying the Arctic warming further. Our results establish the presence of marine phytoplankton as an important potential driver of the future Arctic climate changes.},

In the eastern Bering Sea, spring bloom timing has been linked to ice retreat timing and production of zooplankton and ﬁsh. A large part of the eastern Bering Sea shelf ( \$ 500 km wide) is ice-covered during winter and spring. Four oceanographic moorings have been deployed along the 70-m depth contour of the eastern Bering Sea shelf with the southern location occupied annually since 1995, the two northern locations since 2004 and the remaining location since 2001. Chlorophyll a ﬂuorescence data from the four moorings provide 37 realizations of a spring bloom and 33 realizations of a fall bloom. We found that in the eastern Bering Sea: if ice was present after mid-March, spring bloom timing was related to ice retreat timing (p o0.001, df¼ 1, 24); if ice was absent or retreated before mid-March, a spring bloom usually occurred in May or early June (average day 148, {SE}¼ 3.5, n ¼ 11). A fall bloom also commonly occurred, usually in late September (average day 274, {SE}¼ 4.2, n ¼33), and its timing was not signiﬁcantly related to the timing of storms (p¼0.88, df¼1, 27) or fall water column overturn (p ¼0.49, df¼1, 27). The magnitudes of the spring and fall blooms were correlated (p ¼0.011, df¼28). The interval between the spring and fall blooms varied between four to six months depending on year and location. We present a hypothesis to explain how the large crustacean zooplankton taxa Calanus spp. likely respond to variation in the interval between blooms (spring to fall and fall to spring).},

	abstract = {Predation can play an important role in population, community and ecosystem processes. When predator guilds are diverse, fluctuations in individual predator populations may have small influences on the guild at large, suggesting that predator diversity stabilizes the amount of predation prey experience. The strength of this phenomenon depends on how synchronously populations within predator assemblages vary and whether all predators are equally important consumers. We utilized a database of biomasses of fish species across ten temperate marine ecosystems paired with diet composition and feeding rate information from mass-balance food web models to develop a predation index that weights the importance of predators on a prey based on predator feeding habits. Using the index, we asked how diverse sources of predation in these ecosystems are and how much diversity stabilizes variability in predation. Predator assemblages displayed a wide range of diversity; in one-third of assemblages, a single predator group accounted for over half of all predation. Abundances of predator populations within assemblages generally varied independently of one another (neither synchronously nor asynchronously), implying an intermediate stabilization on predation intensity by predator diversity. Accounting for interaction strength (versus mere presence) is critical for interpreting the predator landscape; doing so led to a wider range in predator assemblage diversity and less synchronous assemblages. This work challenges conventional notions that marine food webs are diverse and therefore less susceptible to predator control. Future work should consider the temporal variability of the predator assemblages and account for differences in mortality induced by each predator population.},

Traditional species distribution models are often applied to scientific-survey data, which include species presence-absence information, to predict distributions. Maximum entropy ({MaxEnt}) models are promising tools as they can be applied to presence-only data (e.g., data collected from fishermen targeting a specific species or from observers in citizen-science programs). We used {MaxEnt} models to relate occurrence records of three marine pelagic fish (Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, and butterfish) in fishery-dependent data to environmental conditions (sea surface temperature ({SST}) and chlorophyll-a concentration from satellite remote sensing, bathymetry, and climate indices), and evaluated model performance by both cross-validation and validation using fishery-independent data. We developed monthly habitat suitability maps for these fish in the Northwest Atlantic Shelf area, and assessed the relative influence of environmental factors on their distributions. Across months, their suitable habitat areas varied with each species exhibiting inshore-offshore and north-south movements in response to changing environmental conditions. Overall, {SST} and chlorophyll-a concentration had the greatest influence on the distributions of these fish, with bathymetry having moderate influence and climate indices having little influence. Our application of {MaxEnt} models enabled us to integrate presence-only data and high resolution environmental data from satellite remote sensing to describe spatiotemporal distributions of marine pelagic fish. These models were used to hindcast species occurrence in relation to historical environmental conditions to evaluate their predictive performance, and have the potential to provide nowcasts in relation to current conditions or forecasts of species future distributions.},

	abstract = {Maintaining a functionally connected network of high-quality habitat is one of the most effective responses to biodiversity loss. However, the spatial distribution of suitable habitat may shift over time in response to climate change. Taxa such as migratory forest landbirds are already undergoing climate-driven range shifts. Therefore, patches of climate-resilient habitat (also known as “climate refugia”) are especially valuable from a conservation perspective. Here, we performed maximum entropy (Maxent) species distribution modeling to predict suitable and potentially climate-resilient habitat in Nova Scotia, Canada, for 3 migratory forest landbirds: Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), Olive-sided Flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), and Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis). We used a reverse stepwise elimination technique to identify covariates that influence habitat suitability for the target species at broad scales, including abiotic (topographic control of moisture and nutrient accumulation) and biotic (forest characteristics) covariates. As topography should be relatively unaffected by a changing climate and helps regulate the structure and composition of forest habitat, we posit that the inclusion of appropriate topographic features may support the identification of climate-resilient habitat. Of all covariates, depth to water table was the most important predictor of relative habitat suitability for the Rusty Blackbird and Canada Warbler, with both species showing a strong association with wet areas. Mean canopy height was the most important predictor for the Olive-sided Flycatcher, whereby the species was associated with taller trees. Our models, which comprise the finest-scale species distribution models available for these species in this region, further indicated that, for all species, habitat (1) remains relatively abundant and well distributed in Nova Scotia and (2) is often located in wet lowlands (a climate-resilient topographic landform). These findings suggest that opportunities remain to conserve breeding habitat for these species despite changing temperature and precipitation regimes.},

This is fundamental for developing effective spatial management strategies and in assessing the response of species to anthropogenic disturbance. This study uses a Bayesian state-space model applied to acoustic transmitter data to describe the temporal and spatial movement patterns of three estuarine ﬁsh species commonly targeted by recreational anglers in southeast Australia: Black Bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri), Sand Flathead (Platycephalus bassensis), and Brown Trout (Salmo trutta). Despite morphological differences between the three species, several common traits were observed in their movement and behaviour. Of the 50 individuals across all three species that were tracked, the vast majority remained within the estuary where they were tagged for the duration of the study. While the home ranges of the three species differed in size, all individuals remained resident around the mid-estuary where the majority of ﬁsh were tagged were released. Each of the species also displayed seasonal migrations, presumably linked to spawning. The timing of the beginning of these migrations was well synchronised both within and among species, starting in late spring/early summer. This suggests that environmental factors such as water temperature and day length may play an important role in cueing spawning behaviour for each of the species. These migratory behaviours suggest adverse changes to estuarine conditions such as reduced river ﬂows may have potential consequences for spawning success for some species and hence implications for ﬁsheries management.},

	abstract = {State-space models ({SSM}) are increasingly applied in studies involving biotelemetry-generated positional data because they are able to estimate movement parameters from positions that are unobserved or have been observed with non-negligible observational error. Popular telemetry systems in marine coastal fish consist of arrays of omnidirectional acoustic receivers, which generate a multivariate time-series of detection events across the tracking period. Here we report a novel Bayesian fitting of a {SSM} application that couples mechanistic movement properties within a home range (a specific case of random walk weighted by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) with a model of observational error typical for data obtained from acoustic receiver arrays. We explored the performance and accuracy of the approach through simulation modelling and extensive sensitivity analyses of the effects of various configurations of movement properties and time-steps among positions. Model results show an accurate and unbiased estimation of the movement parameters, and in most cases the simulated movement parameters were properly retrieved. Only in extreme situations (when fast swimming speeds are combined with pooling the number of detections over long time-steps) the model produced some bias that needs to be accounted for in field applications. Our method was subsequently applied to real acoustic tracking data collected from a small marine coastal fish species, the pearly razorfish, Xyrichtys novacula. The Bayesian {SSM} we present here constitutes an alternative for those used to the Bayesian way of reasoning. Our Bayesian {SSM} can be easily adapted and generalized to any species, thereby allowing studies in freely roaming animals on the ecological and evolutionary consequences of home ranges and territory establishment, both in fishes and in other taxa.},

	abstract = {Accurate modeling of geographic distributions of species is crucial to various applications in ecology and conservation. The best performing techniques often require some parameter tuning, which may be prohibitively time-consuming to do separately for each species, or unreliable for small or biased datasets. Additionally, even with the abundance of good quality data, users interested in the application of species models need not have the statistical knowledge required for detailed tuning. In such cases, it is desirable to use “default settings”, tuned and validated on diverse datasets. Maxent is a recently introduced modeling technique, achieving high predictive accuracy and enjoying several additional attractive properties. The performance of Maxent is influenced by a moderate number of parameters. The first contribution of this paper is the empirical tuning of these parameters. Since many datasets lack information about species absence, we present a tuning method that uses presence-only data. We evaluate our method on independently collected high-quality presence-absence data. In addition to tuning, we introduce several concepts that improve the predictive accuracy and running time of Maxent. We introduce “hinge features” that model more complex relationships in the training data; we describe a new logistic output format that gives an estimate of probability of presence; finally we explore “background sampling” strategies that cope with sample selection bias and decrease model-building time. Our evaluation, based on a diverse dataset of 226 species from 6 regions, shows: 1) default settings tuned on presence-only data achieve performance which is almost as good as if they had been tuned on the evaluation data itself; 2) hinge features substantially improve model performance; 3) logistic output improves model calibration, so that large differences in output values correspond better to large differences in suitability; 4) “target-group” background sampling can give much better predictive performance than random background sampling; 5) random background sampling results in a dramatic decrease in running time, with no decrease in model performance.},

For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efﬁcacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction ({GARP}). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species’ range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in ﬁeld guides. All models were signiﬁcantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic ({ROC}) analyses. The area under the {ROC} curve ({AUC}) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

This paper is written for ecologists and describes the {MaxEnt} model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of {MaxEnt} which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of {MaxEnt} describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Fisheries biology encompasses a tremendous diversity of research questions, methods, and models. Many sub-fields use observational or experimental data to make inference about biological characteristics that are not directly observed (called “latent states”), such as heritability of phenotypic traits, habitat suitability, and population densities to name a few. Latent states will generally cause model residuals to be correlated, violating the assumption of statistical independence made in many statistical modelling approaches. In this exposition, we argue that mixed-effect modelling (i) is an important and generic solution to non-independence caused by latent states; (ii) provides a unifying framework for disparate statistical methods such as time-series, spatial, and individual-based models; and (iii) is increasingly practical to implement and customize for problem-specific models. We proceed by summarizing the distinctions between fixed and random effects, reviewing a generic approach for parameter estimation, and distinguishing general categories of non-linear mixed-effect models. We then provide four worked examples, including state-space, spatial, individual-level variability, and quantitative genetics applications (with working code for each), while providing comparison with conventional fixed-effect implementations. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research in this important framework for modelling and statistical analysis in fisheries biology.},

In some cases, however, invasive species can be managed by directly suppressing populations, and tracking technologies that allow researchers to identify movement patterns and aggregations representative of the population can facilitate suppression activities. In Yellowstone Lake (Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming), invasive lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) have been the target of a population suppression program for over two decades. For this form of management, the reproductive period is particularly important because fish migrate to and from spawning grounds. From 2011 to 2014, adult lake trout (n = 317) in Yellowstone Lake were tracked using acoustic biotelemetry. After controlling for spatial and temporal dependency in the data, total abundance of unique individuals was estimated where migratory trajectories occurred at confirmed spawning sites. Aggregations and migratory trajectories were further estimated at locations where spawning had not previously been observed. Across years, the greatest number of individuals was observed along a migration corridor in the southwestern area of the lake. Novel strategies for analyzing acoustic telemetry data provided insights into the behavior of an invasive fish species. By betraying the positions of conspecifics, tagged fish revealed potentially important reproductive habitats and migration corridors that warranted further investigation as possible sites for population suppression.},

We explored interactions between native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the context of this resource pulse. Diets surveyed before and during salmon spawning showed that, regardless of species, trout consumed 4.5-fold more biomass during than before salmon runs. Brook trout grew more quickly than brown trout under controlled feeding regimes due, in part, to their higher food conversion efﬁciency of 36\% compared with 21\%. Bioenergetics model simulations explored the inﬂuence of temperature on the exploitation of resource pulses and found 35\% lower growth rates and increased gorging at colder temperatures. Overall, we found evidence that brook trout and brown trout foraging and growth are modulated by the salmon resource pulse, especially through gorging on eggs. However, these species exhibit distinct physiological adaptations and environmental preferences that may inﬂuence their ultimate capacity to exploit resource pulses. The effects of environmental conditions and salmon subsidies on stream-resident trout have broader consequences for ﬁsheries management and conservation efforts.},

	doi = {10.1002/2017JC012828},
	abstract = {Algae growing in sea ice represent a source of carbon for sympagic and pelagic ecosystems and contribute to the biological carbon pump. The biophysical habitat of sea ice on large scales and the physical drivers of algae phenology are key to understanding Arctic ecosystem dynamics and for predicting its response to ongoing Arctic climate change. In addition, quantifying potential feedback mechanisms between algae and physical processes is particularly important during a time of great change. These mechanisms include a shading effect due to the presence of algae and increased basal ice melt. The present study shows pan-Arctic results obtained from a new Sea Ice Model for Bottom Algae ({SIMBA}) coupled with a 3-D sea-ice–ocean model. The model is evaluated with data collected during a ship-based campaign to the Eastern Central Arctic in summer 2012. The algal bloom is triggered by light and shows a latitudinal dependency. Snow and ice also play a key role in ice algal growth. Simulations show that after the spring bloom, algae are nutrient limited before the end of summer and ﬁnally they leave the ice habitat during ice melt. The spatial distribution of ice algae at the end of summer agrees with available observations, and it emphasizes the importance of thicker sea-ice regions for hosting biomass. Particular attention is given to the distinction between level ice and ridged ice. Ridge-associated algae are strongly light limited, but they can thrive toward the end of summer, and represent an additional carbon source during the transition into polar night.},

	abstract = {Arctic organisms are adapted to the strong seasonality of environmental forcing. A small timing mismatch between biological processes and the environment could potentially have significant consequences for the entire food web. Climate warming causes shrinking ice coverage and earlier ice retreat in the Arctic, which is likely to change the timing of primary production. In this study, we test predictions on the interactions among sea ice phenology and production timing of ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton. We do so using the following (1) a synthesis of available satellite observation data; and (2) the application of a coupled ice-ocean ecosystem model. The data and model results suggest that, over a large portion of the Arctic marginal seas, the timing variability in ice retreat at a specific location has a strong impact on the timing variability in pelagic phytoplankton peaks, but weak or no impact on the timing of ice-algae peaks in those regions. The model predicts latitudinal and regional differences in the timing of ice algae biomass peak (varying from April to May) and the time lags between ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton peaks (varying from 45 to 90 days). The correlation between the time lag and ice retreat is significant in areas where ice retreat has no significant impact on ice-algae peak timing, suggesting that changes in pelagic phytoplankton peak timing control the variability in time lags. Phenological variability in primary production is likely to have consequences for higher trophic levels, particularly for the zooplankton grazers, whose main food source is composed of the dually pulsed algae production of the Arctic.},

This is because co-occurrence among species is a measurable metric in community datasets that, in the context of phylogeny, geography, traits, and environment, can sometimes indicate the degree of competition, displacement, and phylogenetic repulsion as weighed against biotic and environmental eﬀects promoting correlated species distributions. Historically, a multitude of diﬀerent co-occurrence metrics have been developed and most have depended on data randomization procedures to produce null distributions for signiﬁcance testing. Here we improve upon and present an R implementation of a recently published model that is metric-free, distribution-free, and randomization-free.

Control of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) populations in Lake Michigan, beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, had profound effects on the food web. Recoveries of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and burbot (Lota lota) populations, as well as the buildup of salmonine populations, were attributable, at least in part, to sea lamprey control. Based on our analyses, predation by salmonines was primarily responsible for the reduction in alewife abundance during the 1970s and early 1980s. In turn, the decrease in alewife abundance likely contributed to recoveries of deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsoni), yellow perch (Perca flavescens), and burbot populations during the 1970s and 1980s. Decrease in the abundance of all three dominant benthic macroinvertebrate groups, including Diporeia, oligochaetes, and sphaeriids, during the 1980s in nearshore waters (≤50 m deep) of Lake Michigan, was attributable to a decrease in primary production linked to a decline in phosphorus loadings. Continued decrease in Diporeia abundance during the 1990s was associated with the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion, but specific mechanisms for zebra mussels affecting Diporeia abundance remain unidentified.},

	volume = {11},
	abstract = {Sculpin fishes belonging to the family Cottidae represent a large and complex group,
inhabiting a wide range of freshwater, brackish-water, and marine environments. Numerous studies
based on analysis of their morphology and genetic makeup frequently provided controversial results.
In the present work, we sequenced complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes and fragments of nuclear
ribosomal {DNA} ({rDNA}) of the fourhorn sculpin Myoxocephalus quadricornis and some related cottids to
increase the power of phylogenetic and taxonomic analyses of this complex fish group. A comparison
of the My. quadricornis mt genomes obtained by us with other complete mt genomes available in
{GenBank} has revealed a surprisingly low divergence (3.06   0.12\%) with Megalocottus platycephalus
and, at the same time, a significantly higher divergence (7.89   0.16\%) with the species of the genus
Myoxocephalus. Correspondingly, phylogenetic analyses have shown that My. quadricornis is clustered
with Me. platycephalus but not with the Myoxocephalus species. Completely consistent patterns of
divergence and tree topologies have been obtained based on nuclear {rDNA}. Thus, the multi-gene data
in the present work indicates obvious contradictions in the relationships between the Myoxocephalus
and Megalocottus species studied. An extensive phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for a
closer a nity of My. quadricornis with the species of the genus Megalocottus than with the species
of the genus Myoxocephalus. A recombination analysis, along with the additional {GenBank} data,
excludes introgression and/or incorrect taxonomic identification as the possible causative factors
responsible for the observed closer a nity between the two species from di erent genera. The above
facts necessitate realignment of the genera Myoxocephalus and Megalocottus. The genetic data supports
the two recognized genera, Myoxocephalus and Megalocottus, but suggests changing their compositions
through transferring My. quadricornis to the genus Megalocottus. The results of the present study
resolve the relationships within a complex group of sculpin fishes and show a promising approach
to phylogenetic systematics (as a key organizing principle in biodiversity research) for a better
understanding of the taxonomy and evolution of fishes and for supplying relevant information to
address various fish biodiversity conservation and management issues.},

	abstract = {We have previously shown in rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss) that gastric distension induces an instantaneous α-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in the dorsal aortic blood pressure (P
              da
              ), with no change in cardiac output ({CO}), gut blood flow (Q
              cma
              ), or heart rate. To investigate if feeding habits affect these patterns and to compare the differences between gastric distension alone and feeding in the same experimental setting, we used the short-horn sculpin ( Myoxocephalus scorpius), an inactive ambush predator with a capacity to eat large meals. An inflatable balloon was placed in the stomach of one group while another group was fed fish meat. When distending the stomach with a volume corresponding to a meal of 8–10\% body weight, there is a profound and long-lasting increase in systemic (123 ± 27\%) and gastrointestinal (R
              cma
              ; 82 ± 24\%) vascular resistance, leading to an increase in P
              da
              (19\%) without any change in {CO} or Q
              cma
              . After force-feeding, there is a rapid transient increase in R
              cma
              (24 ± 4\%) and an even larger P
              da
              response (53\%). There is also a subsequent increase in both {CO} (28 ± 8\%) and Q
              cma
              (27 ± 9\%) after 30 min. By 15 h, {CO} and Q
              cma
              increase further (41 ± 11 and 63 ± 14\%, respectively), and this increase persists for up to 60 h. The increase in Q
              cma
              is mediated via both an increase in {CO} and a shunting of blood from the systemic circulation via a decrease in R
              cma
              (34 ± 7\%). In conclusion, the response to mechanical distension of the stomach is similar to what we have described in rainbow trout, and the postprandial gastrointestinal hyperemia is most likely chemically induced.},

Here, we examined the thermal sensitivity of cardiorespiratory performance for three closely related species of sculpins that inhabit the Arctic waters, two of which, Gymnocanthus tricuspis and Myoxocephalus scorpioides, have adapted to a restricted range within the Arctic, whereas the third species, Myoxocephalus scorpius, has a wider distribution. We tested the hypothesis that the fish restricted to Arctic cold waters would show reduced cardiorespiratory scope in response to an increase in temperature, as compared with the more eurythermal M. scorpius. As expected from their biogeography, M. scorpioides and G. tricuspis maximised cardiorespiratory performance at temperatures between 1 and 4°C, whereas M. scorpius maximised performance over a wider range of temperatures (1–10°C). Furthermore, factorial scope for cardiac output collapsed at elevated temperature for the two high-latitude species, negatively impacting their ability to support aerobically driven metabolic processes. Consequently, these results concurred with our hypothesis, suggesting that the sculpin species restricted to the Arctic are likely to be negatively impacted by increases in ocean temperatures.},

To better understand small-scale, predator–prey co-occurrence, the spatial patterns and behaviour of age 0 juvenile cod Gadus morhua 75–88 mm {SL} and two of their known predators, age 2+ cod and short-horn sculpin Myoxocephalus scorpinus, were examined in two habitats (i.e., sand and eelgrass) using three-dimensional video analysis. Both habitat and predator type interacted to result in unique spatial patterns of prey. Spatial overlap between predators and prey was highest in open habitat in the presence of the cruising predator but lowest in the presence of sculpin in the same habitat. In eelgrass, age 0 cod avoided predators primarily along the vertical axis (i.e., distance off bottom). Age 0 cod stayed above eelgrass in the presence of sculpin but lowered themselves into the eelgrass while in the presence of predator cod. Anti-predator behaviour (i.e., predator–prey distance, prey cohesion and freezing) was significantly reduced over eelgrass compared to sand, suggesting eelgrass has lower dinherent {riskT} than open habitats. However, predator consumption was similar across all treatments, suggesting that, 1) complex habitat also impairs the visual cues needed for anti-predator behaviour (e.g., schooling) and assessing the location of predators, and 2) predators change their behaviour with habitat to enhance their opportunities for finding and capturing prey.

	abstract = {Both oxygen and temperature are fundamental factors determining metabolic performance, fitness, ecological niches, and responses of many aquatic organisms to climate change. Despite the importance of physical and physiological constraints on oxygen supply affecting aerobic metabolism of aquatic ectotherms, ecological theories such as the metabolic theory of ecology have focused on the effects of temperature rather than oxygen. This gap currently impedes mechanistic models from accurately predicting metabolic rates (i.e., oxygen consumption rates) of aquatic organisms and restricts predictions to resting metabolism, which is less affected by oxygen limitation. Here, we expand on models of metabolic scaling by accounting for the role of oxygen availability and temperature on both resting and active metabolic rates. Our model predicts that oxygen limitation is more likely to constrain metabolism in larger, warmer, and active fish. Consequently, active metabolic rates are less responsive to temperature than are resting metabolic rates, and metabolism scales to body size with a smaller exponent whenever temperatures or activity levels are higher. Results from a metaanalysis of fish metabolic rates are consistent with our model predictions. The observed interactive effects of temperature, oxygen availability, and body size predict that global warming will limit the aerobic scope of aquatic ectotherms and may place a greater metabolic burden on larger individuals, impairing their physiological performance in the future. Our model reconciles the metabolic theory with empirical observations of oxygen limitation and provides a formal, quantitative framework for predicting both resting and active metabolic rate and hence aerobic scope of aquatic ectotherms.},

Regression analysis was used to illustrate interspecific variation in ontogenetic patterns of prey size use, gape allometries, and ratio-based trophic niche breadths. Sizebased feeding strategies were assessed through comparison of frequency distributions of relative prey sizes eaten and were related to general predator feeding tactics and gape morphology. The results demonstrated that the range of prey sizes eaten expanded with increasing predator body size for each of the marine predators examined, leading to asymmetric predator size - prey size distributions. Absolute maximum prey size and slopes of maximum prey size versus predator size varied widely among predator taxa. Distinct size-based feeding strategies were evident, as diets of some predators were dominated by prey that were 10 to 20\% of predator size, whereas other predators frequently consumed prey {\textgreater} 50\% of predator size. Gape sizes and allometric relationships with body size were also diverse among predators and often were closely associated with maximum prey sizes. Ratio-based trophic-niche breadths generally did not expand with predator ontogeny and tended to narrow for the largest predators, which may be common for animal taxa.},

To understand how the diet of non-native fishes varies based on habitat type, we studied 12 populations of 6 non-native fish species with the aim of verifying whether diet, niche breadth, or trophic guild vary between lentic and lotic habitats. Fish were sampled in both habitats in the Paranapanema River basin between August 2014 and March 2016. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance – {PERMANOVA} was applied so that the composition of fish diet could be compared between habitats. Levin’s standardized index was used to evaluate the trophic niche breadth of the species, revealing differences in the diets of Ossancora eigenmanni, Auchenipterus osteomystax and Trachelyopterus galeatus based on habitats. Seven trophic guilds were identified, and those for Serrasalmus marginatus, Loricariichthys platymetopon, and T. galeatus were the same (piscivores, detritivores, and omnivores, respectively) in both habitats. In contrast, the trophic guilds of O. eigenmanni, A. osteomystax, and Plagioscion squamosissimus varied between the habitats. Habitat-specific variability in the diet composition of the species and, for the most, the niche breadth in the lotic habitats increased; therefore, we conclude that this type of environment can provide access to a greater variety of food resources for non-native fishes.},

	abstract = {The range of resources that a species uses (i.e. its niche breadth) might determine the geographical area it can occupy, but consensus on whether a niche breadth–range size relationship generally exists among species has been slow to emerge. The validity of this hypothesis is a key question in ecology in that it proposes a mechanism for commonness and rarity, and if true, may help predict species' vulnerability to extinction. We identified 64 studies that measured niche breadth and range size, and we used a meta-analytic approach to test for the presence of a niche breadth–range size relationship. We found a significant positive relationship between range size and environmental tolerance breadth (z = 0.49), habitat breadth (z = 0.45), and diet breadth (z = 0.28). The overall positive effect persisted even when incorporating sampling effects. Despite significant variability in the strength of the relationship among studies, the general positive relationship suggests that specialist species might be disproportionately vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change due to synergistic effects of a narrow niche and small range size. An understanding of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that drive and cause deviations from this niche breadth–range size pattern is an important future research goal.},

In 2008, the first discovery of White Perch in Lake James, North Carolina, provided a rare opportunity to investigate trophic overlap between White Perch and a robust population of White Bass near the onset of invasion. We investigated the potential for resource competition between White Perch and White Bass by assessing their relative abundance ({CPUE}), trophic position, niche size, diet breadth, and diet overlap across 2 years. White Perch were more abundant than White Bass and had wider diet breadth and trophic niche size across seasons. White Perch also occupied lower trophic positions than White Bass, indicating that White Bass maintain a more piscivorous diet. However, diet and stable isotope analysis showed a high overlap between juvenile White Bass and all sizes of White Perch. Thus, juvenile White Bass may be susceptible to competition with White Perch where resources are limited. Therefore, biologists should take steps to prevent White Perch introductions into systems with popular White Bass fisheries.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after {McArdle} and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for {ANOVA} (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by {McArdle} and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the ﬂexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The teststatistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

	title = {Optimal swim speeds for traversing velocity barriers: an analysis of volitional high-speed swimming behavior of migratory ﬁshes},
	abstract = {Summary Migrating ﬁsh traversing velocity barriers are often forced to swim at speeds greater than their maximum sustained speed (Ums). Failure to select an appropriate swim speed under these conditions can prevent ﬁsh from successfully negotiating otherwise passable barriers. I propose a new model of a distance-maximizing strategy for ﬁshes traversing velocity barriers, derived from the relationships between swim speed and fatigue time in both prolonged and sprint modes. The model predicts that ﬁsh will maximize traversed distance by swimming at a constant groundspeed against a range of ﬂow velocities, and this groundspeed is equal to the negative inverse of the slope of the swim speed–fatigue time relationship for each mode. At a predictable ﬂow velocity, they should switch from the optimal groundspeed for prolonged mode to that for sprint mode. Data from six migratory ﬁsh species (anadromous clupeids: American shad Alosa sapidissima, alewife A. pseudoharengus and blueback herring A. aestivalis; amphidromous: striped bass Morone saxatilis; and potomodromous species: walleye (previously known as Stizostedion vitrium) and white sucker Catostomus commersonii) were used to explore the ability of ﬁsh to approximate the predicted distance-maximizing behaviors, as well as the consequences of deviating from the optima. Fish volitionally sprinted up an open-channel ﬂume against ﬁxed ﬂow velocities of 1.5–4.5·m·s–1, providing data on swim speeds and fatigue times, as well as their groundspeeds. Only anadromous clupeids selected the appropriate distance-maximizing groundspeed at both prolonged and sprint modes. The other three species maintained groundspeeds appropriate to the prolonged mode, even when they should have switched to the sprint optima. Because of this, these species failed to maximize distance of ascent. The observed behavioral variability has important implications both for distributional limits and ﬁshway design.},

	abstract = {Most studies on behavioural contributions to dispersal and recruitment during early life history stages of ﬁshes have focused on coral reef species. For cold ocean environments, high variation in seasonal temperature and development times suggest that parallel studies on active behaviour are needed for coldwater species. Thus, we examined the critical swimming speed (Ucrit) of marine ﬁsh larvae from 2 contrasting species: Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod) and Myoxocephalus scorpius (shorthorn sculpin), a pelagic and bottom spawner respectively. Within-species comparisons showed that sculpin reared at 6 °C had lower initial Ucrit values, but a faster Ucrit increase through development compared with 3 °C conspeciﬁcs, ultimately resulting in faster critical swimming speeds at metamorphosis (10.5 vs. 9.1 cm·s−1). In contrast, although cod larvae reared at 10 °C were faster swimmers at ﬁrst feeding than 6 °C ﬁsh, temperature differences were absent after the ﬁrst week. These results show that temperature inﬂuences the trajectory of larval critical swimming speed development, but that the relationship is species-speciﬁc. Although 6 °C sculpin and cod of similar length had equivalent Ucrit values, the smaller size of cod at hatch (5.3 vs. 10.8 mm for sculpin) resulted in much lower age-speciﬁc Ucrit values for cod. These data have signiﬁcant implications for how swimming activity of the two species might affect dispersal, particularly in the ﬁrst few weeks post-hatch. Overall, our data suggest that temperature during larval development inﬂuences the swimming capacity of cold-water marine ﬁshes, and has important ramiﬁcations for biophysical models of dispersal.},

We assessed goby swimming inclination by recording activity in a 2 m flume over a {\textasciitilde}24 h period, and swimming potential using a critical swimming (Ucrit) test, as well as burst tests in still and flowing water. When given the choice to move, gobies covered as much as 14 m/h, with a slight bias towards nocturnal activity and an overall upstream preference. When confined and coerced to perform a Ucrit test, they burst-and-held to achieve 35.5±1.1 cm/s. Thirty minutes following Ucrit, they were able to burst-and-coast in a sprint test to almost twice this speed. In still water, they exhibited startle bursts of up to 163 cm/s. We provide a swimming endurance model that indicates flow rates would need to be {\textgreater}125 cm/s to prevent upstream movement, and free of refuge areas in which to recover. The current study shows that the round goby is a surprisingly powerful swimmer with the capacity to continue its invasion should hydrologic control be absent.},

We used electromyogram telemetry to estimate instantaneous swimming speeds for individual sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) during their spawning migrations through reaches which spanned a gradient in river hydraulic features in the Fraser River, British Columbia. Our main objectives were to describe patterns of individual-speciﬁc swim speeds and behaviours, identify swimming speed strategies and contrast these between sexes, species and reaches. Although mean swimming speeds did not differ between pink salmon (2.21 {BL} s−1) and sockeye salmon (1.60 {BL} s−1), sockeye salmon were over twice as variable (mean {CV}; 54.78) in swimming speeds as pink salmon (mean {CV}; 22.54). Using laboratory-derived criteria, we classiﬁed swimming speeds as sustained ({\textless}2.5 {BL} s−1), prolonged (2.5–3.2 {BL} s−1), or burst ({\textgreater}3.2 {BL} s−1). We found no differences between sexes or species in the proportion of total time swimming in these categories – sustained (0.76), prolonged (0.18), burst (0.06); numbers are based on species and sexes combined. Reaches with relatively complex hydraulics and fast surface currents had migrants with relatively high levels of swimming speed variation (e.g., high swimming speed {CV}, reduced proportions of sustained speeds, elevated proportions of burst speeds, and high rates of bursts) and high frequency of river crossings. We speculate that complex current patterns generated by river constrictions created confusing migration cues, which impeded a salmon’s ability to locate appropriate pathways.},

This study aimed to investigate the influence of ocean acidification and warming on maximum performance parameters of B. saida as indicators for the species’ acclimation capacities under environmental conditions projected for the end of this century. After 4 months at four acclimation temperatures (0, 3, 6, 8°C) each combined with two {PCO}2 levels (390 and 1170 µatm), aerobic capacities and swimming performance of B. saida were recorded following a Ucrit protocol. At both {CO}2 levels, standard metabolic rate ({SMR}) was elevated at the highest acclimation temperature indicating thermal limitations. Maximum metabolic rate ({MMR}) increased continuously with temperature, suggesting an optimum temperature for aerobic scope for exercise ({ASex}) at 6°C. Aerobic swimming performance (Ugait) increased with acclimation temperature irrespective of {CO}2 levels, while critical swimming speed (Ucrit) did not reveal any clear trend with temperature. Hypercapnia evoked an increase in {MMR} (and thereby {ASex}). However, swimming performance (both Ugait and Ucrit) was impaired under elevated nearfuture {PCO}2 conditions, indicating reduced efficiencies of oxygen turnover. The contribution of anaerobic metabolism to swimming performance was very low overall, and further reduced under hypercapnia. Our results revealed high sensitivities of maximum performance parameters ({MMR}, Ugait, Ucrit) of B. saida to ocean acidification. Impaired swimming capacity under ocean acidification may reflect reduced future competitive strength of B. saida.},

	abstract = {Reduction of ecosystem connectivity has long-lasting impacts on food webs. Anadromous fish, which migrate from marine to freshwater ecosystems to complete reproduction, have seen their historically larger ecosystem role undercut by widespread riverine habitat fragmentation and other impacts mainly derived from anthropogenic sources. The result has been extensive extirpations and increased susceptibility to a suite of environmental factors that currently impede recovery. Under this present-day context of reduced productivity and connectivity, aggressive management actions and enforcement of catch limits including bycatch caps and complete moratoria on harvest have followed. What remains less understood are the implications of changes to food webs that co-occurred. What benefits restoration could provide in terms of ecosystem functioning in relation to economic costs associated with dam removal and remediation is unknown and can limit the scope and value of restoration activities. Here we employ, historical landscape-based biomass estimates of anadromous alosine for the first time in an ecosystem modeling of the Northeast {US} large marine ecosystem ({LME}), to evaluate the value of improving connectivity by measuring the increase in energy flow and population productivity. We compared a restored alosine model to a contemporary model, analyzing the impacts of the potential increase of connectivity between riverine and oceanic systems. There was the potential for a moderate biomass increase of piscivorous species with high economic value, including Atlantic cod, and for a major increase for species of conservation concern such as pelagic sharks, seabirds and marine mammals. Our study highlights the benefits of increased connectivity between freshwater and ocean ecosystems. We demonstrate the significant role anadromous forage fish could play in improving specific fisheries and overall ecosystem functioning, mainly through the diversification of species capable of transferring primary production to upper trophic levels, adding to benefits associated with their restoration.},

We captured, tagged (n014,040 individuals, 30–110 mm), and recaptured from Feb 2001 to Jul 2002, although most recaptures (75–95\% by tagging location) occurred within 150 days. Seasonal residency and movements were common among most subhabitats based on catch per unit effort and recapture per unit effort. Thus, these (marsh pools, intertidal and subtidal creeks, and marsh surface) should be considered natural subhabitats within New England type salt marshes. Further, all these subhabitat types should be included in studies of salt marsh nekton and marsh restoration and creation activities.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management, which considers the interactions between fisheries, target species, and the physical and biological components of ecosystems, is necessary to ensure that directed fisheries avoid adverse impacts to ecosystems over the long term. The successful implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management requires an understanding of predator−prey relationships and ways to operationalize such relationships to inform fisheries management. Here, we investigated if the diet of a generalist predator, Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, can be used as an indicator of the abundance of 2 commercially exploited prey species (haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and Acadian redfish Sebastes fasciatus) in the Gulf of Maine. Because haddock and redfish eaten by puffins are juveniles (age 0), there is potential to use their proportions and lengths in puffin diet to better understand the processes influencing haddock and redfish recruitment. By using principal component analysis to develop measures of diet across multiple puffin colonies, we show both spatial variation and large-scale patterns in the proportions and lengths of haddock and redfish in puffin diet. Spawning stock biomass was a strong predictor of haddock proportion in puffin diet and a moderate predictor of redfish proportion; however, proportions in puffin diet did not predict age-1 recruitment, suggesting that variation in recruitment is caused by processes that occur after the puffin breeding season and which affect the survival of older juveniles. Haddock length on one colony was a moderate predictor of age-1 recruitment. We conclude that puffin diet can be used as an indicator of haddock and redfish abundance.},

This study extends previous calibration studies, explores how well tail-beat frequency transmitters fulﬁll their role, and presents a procedure to convert acceleration data into metabolic cost within a framework consistent with traditional ﬁsh bioenergetics models and thus facilitates comparisons of energetic costs between natural ﬁsh populations. These objectives were achieved by comparing data from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a laboratory setting with data from three natural populations. In the laboratory, tail-beat frequency, acceleration values, and oxygen consumption increased progressively with swimming speed. In the wild, individual swimming speeds estimated from positional telemetry were consistently underestimated by, but positively related to, transmitter-based acceleration values. The proposed rationale to estimate metabolic rate from acceleration data accounts for variation in ﬁsh mass and environmental temperature. We demonstrated how this novel method permits comparison of metabolic costs associated with the levels of activity typical of lake trout living in two different lakes.},

Boneﬁsh were found to exhibit relatively low activity levels in the ﬁeld with no evidence of diel patterns or inter-sexual variation. Low activity levels reported by the accelerometers reﬂected low swimming speeds and intermittent swimming behaviours (i.e., swim-then-drift) that maximized energy efﬁciency. Such behaviours were also observed when conducting ethograms on boneﬁsh held in a large ﬁeld mesocosm. Laboratory derived standard metabolic rates and maximum metabolic rates during recovery from exercise were combined with acceleration transmitter calibrations to determine that individual boneﬁsh typically operate at between 40 and 60\% of their estimated metabolic scope in the ﬁeld. However, occasionally acceleration values in the ﬁeld were indicative of high intensity bursting activity that exhausted the majority of their estimated metabolic scope (0.7\% of all ﬁeld observations exceed 90\% of estimated metabolic scope). Data gathered in this study provide a critical starting point for the development of a bioenergetics model for boneﬁsh which will ultimately lend clues into how ﬁsh make a living in tropical tidal ﬂats environments. Given that this paper is one of the ﬁrst to use transmitters rather than archival loggers to collect data on tri-axial acceleration on ﬁsh, we also discuss the opportunities and limitations of using this new technology for marine ﬁsheries research.},

	abstract = {Monitoring and measuring the behaviour and movement of aquatic animals in the wild is typically challenging, though microaccelerometer (archival or telemetry) tags now provide the means to remotely identify and quantify behavioural states and rates such as resting, swimming and migrating, and to estimate activity and energy budgets. Most studies use low-frequency (≤32Hz) accelerometer sampling because of battery and data-archiving constraints. In this study we assessed the effect of sampling frequency (aliasing) on activity detection probability using the great sculpin (Myoxocephalus polyacanthoceaphalus) as a model species. Feeding strikes and escape responses (fast-start activities) and spontaneous movements among seven different great sculpin were triggered, observed and recorded using video records and a tri-axial accelerometer sampling at 100Hz. We demonstrate that multiple parameters in the time and probability domains can statistically differentiate between activities with high detection (90\%) and identification (80\%) probabilities. Detection probability for feeding and escape activities decreased by 50\% when sampling at {\textless}10Hz. Our analyses illustrate additional problems associated with aliasing and how activity and energybudget estimates can be compromised and misinterpreted. We recommend that high-frequency ({\textgreater}30Hz) accelerometer sampling be used in similar laboratory and field studies. If battery and/or data storage is limited, we also recommend archiving the events via an on-board algorithm that determines the highest likelihood and subsequent archiving of the various event classes of interest.},

Here, we used tri-axial accelerometer biologgers to determine accelerometric predictors of bonefish Albula vulpes behaviours (resting, swimming, bursting, coasting, and foraging) in a wetland mesocosm in Eleuthera, The Bahamas. We also used a swim flume to estimate the relationship between acceleration and swimming speed for bonefish (n = 9). In the wetland study, 5 bonefish were tagged externally with accelerometer loggers and monitored for a 5 d period during which visual behavioural observations were conducted for 4 h. Classification tree models were used to identify accelerometric criteria for bonefish behaviours, and a classification algorithm was applied to estimate behavioural frequencies for bonefish in the wetland for the 5 d period. Bonefish spent the majority of time resting (57\%), followed by swimming (26\%) and coasting (17\%), and foraged an average of 11 times h−1. Bonefish exhibited primarily slow swimming speeds (average 0.18 m s−1) while in the wetland, with occasional burst swimming events (14 h−1) to maximum swimming speeds ranging from 4.3 to 6.4 m s−1 across individuals. Swimming and foraging behaviours varied among individuals and over the diel cycle. Bonefish generally swam most at dawn and foraged most at night. Temperature and tide were also significant predictors of swimming behaviour, and fish were generally most active at lower temperatures ({\textasciitilde}24°C) and during ebbing tidal periods despite the fact that the wetland was disconnected from the ocean. The ability to estimate fine-scale behaviours such as foraging and activity levels has important implications for understanding energy dynamics, which is fundamental to the fitness of wild fish.},

	abstract = {1. We examined published studies relating resting oxygen consumption to body mass and temperature in post-larval teleost fish. The resulting database comprised 138 studies of 69 species (representing 28 families and 12 orders) living over a temperature range of c. 40 °C. 2. Resting metabolic rate (Rb; mmol oxygen gas h–1) was related to body mass (M; wet mass, g) by Rb = {aMb}, where a is a constant and b the scaling exponent. The model was fitted by least squares linear regression after logarithmic transformation of both variables. The mean value of scaling exponent, b, for the 69 individual species was 0·79 ({SE} 0·11). The general equation for all teleost fish was 1nRb = 0·80(1nM) – 5·43. 3. The relationship between resting oxygen consumption and environmental temperature for a 50-g fish was curvilinear. A typical tropical fish at 30°C requires approximately six times as much oxygen for resting metabolism as does a polar fish at 0°C. This relationship could be fitted by several statistical models, of which the Arrhenius model is probably the most appropriate. The Arrhenius model for the resting metabolism of 69 species of teleost fish, corrected to a standard body mass of 50 g, was 1nRb = 15·7 – 5·02.T–1, where T is absolute temperature (103 × K). 4. The Arrhenius model fitted to all 69 species exhibited a lower thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism (mean Q10 = 1·83 over the range 0–30 °C) than typical within-species acclimation studies (median Q10 = 2·40, n = 14). This suggests that evolutionary adaptation has reduced the overall thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism across species. Analysis of covariance indicated that the relationships between resting metabolic rate and temperature for various taxa (orders) showed similar slopes but significantly different mean rates. 5. Analysis of the data for perciform fish provided no support for metabolic cold adaptation (the hypothesis that polar fish show a resting metabolic rate higher than predicted from the overall rate/temperature relationship established for temperate and tropical species). 6. Taxonomic variation in mean resting metabolic rate showed no relationship to phylogeny, although the robustness of this conclusion is constrained by our limited knowledge of fish evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {1 Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2 This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees ({BRT}), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final {BRT} model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3 Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in {BRT} overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although {BRT} models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4 The unique features of {BRT} raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using {BRT} through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of {BRT} by ecologists.},

	abstract = {Ongoing and predicted global change makes understanding and predicting species' range shifts an urgent scientific priority. Here, we provide a synthetic perspective on the so far poorly understood effects of interspecific interactions on range expansion rates. We present theoretical foundations for how interspecific interactions may modulate range expansion rates, consider examples from empirical studies of biological invasions and natural range expansions as well as process-based simulations, and discuss how interspecific interactions can be more broadly represented in process-based, spatiotemporally explicit range forecasts. Theory tells us that interspecific interactions affect expansion rates via alteration of local population growth rates and spatial displacement rates, but also via effects on other demographic parameters. The best empirical evidence for interspecific effects on expansion rates comes from studies of biological invasions. Notably, invasion studies indicate that competitive dominance and release from specialized enemies can enhance expansion rates. Studies of natural range expansions especially point to the potential for competition from resident species to reduce expansion rates. Overall, it is clear that interspecific interactions may have important consequences for range dynamics, but also that their effects have received too little attention to robustly generalize on their importance. We then discuss how interspecific interactions effects can be more widely incorporated in dynamic modeling of range expansions. Importantly, models must describe spatiotemporal variation in both local population dynamics and dispersal. Finally, we derive the following guidelines for when it is particularly important to explicitly represent interspecific interactions in dynamic range expansion forecasts: if most interacting species show correlated spatial or temporal trends in their effects on the target species, if the number of interacting species is low, and if the abundance of one or more strongly interacting species is not closely linked to the abundance of the target species.},

This is done using the relative dispersion of patient and hospital contributions to the fitted outcomes. As is seen, this question is distinct from other common questions, including the quality of the overall fit, the degree to which the outcome is accurately predicted, the statistical significance of groups of predictors, and the correlations among and between groups of predictors. Relevant point estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests are developed. In the example, we examine three outcome measures and find that nearly all of the predictable variation in patient outcomes and most of the predictable variation in outcomes among hospitals reflects variation in patient characteristics rather than hospital characteristics; however, this is true in varying degrees for the three outcomes.},

We examined geographic variation in the feeding ecology and distribution of coral-feeding butterflyfish to determine the influence of dietary specialization and dietary resource availability on their local abundance. Dietary composition and abundance of five butterflyfish and coral dietary resource availability were determined at 45 sites across five locations (Lizard Island and Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef; Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea; Noumea, New Caledonia; and Moorea, French Polynesia). Multiple regression models using variables representative of total dietary resource availability, availability of specific dietary resources, and interspecific competition were used to determine the best predictors of local abundance across all sites and locations for each species. Factors influencing local abundance varied between butterflyfish with specialized and generalized diets. Dietary resource availability had the strongest influence on the abundance of Chaetodon trifascialis—the most specialized species. Local abundance of C. trifascialis was best predicted by availability of the Acropora corals that it preferentially feeds on. In contrast, abundance of generalist butterflyfish was poorly described by variation in availability of specific resources. Rather, indices of total dietary resource availability best predicted their abundance. Overall, multiple regression models only explained a small proportion of the variation in local abundance for all five species. Despite their relatively specialized diets, dietary resource availability has limited influence on the local abundance of butterflyfish. Only the most specialized species appear to be consistently limited by prey availability. Local and total abundance of species are influenced by a wide range of different factors and there is definite need to conduct independent species assessments.},

Although mortality can be difﬁcult to identify, it is unclear how frequent mortality is considered or incorporated in acoustic telemetry research, particularly studies relating to the behaviour of tagged animals. The main objective of this review was to characterize if and how mortality was incorporated in recent acoustic telemetry articles published during 2015–2019.

              A 15-yr duration record of mooring observations from the eastern ({\textgreater}70°E) Eurasian Basin ({EB}) of the Arctic Ocean is used to show and quantify the recently increased oceanic heat flux from intermediate-depth ({\textasciitilde}150–900 m) warm Atlantic Water ({AW}) to the surface mixed layer and sea ice. The upward release of {AW} heat is regulated by the stability of the overlying halocline, which we show has weakened substantially in recent years. Shoaling of the {AW} has also contributed, with observations in winter 2017–18 showing {AW} at only 80 m depth, just below the wintertime surface mixed layer, the shallowest in our mooring records. The weakening of the halocline for several months at this time implies that {AW} heat was linked to winter convection associated with brine rejection during sea ice formation. This resulted in a substantial increase of upward oceanic heat flux during the winter season, from an average of 3–4 W m
              −2
              in 2007–08 to {\textgreater}10 W m
              −2
              in 2016–18. This seasonal {AW} heat loss in the eastern {EB} is equivalent to a more than a twofold reduction of winter ice growth. These changes imply a positive feedback as reduced sea ice cover permits increased mixing, augmenting the summer-dominated ice-albedo feedback.},

The effect of increasing temperature on the growth of juvenile Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), a cold-water species, circum-continental in the Arctic, was investigated on juveniles that had been captured in the wild and kept in captivity. Mortality rate increased with higher tem­ perature, from 4.5 \% at 4.0 ◦C to 15.2 \% at 7.5 ◦C. Relative growth (normalized in degree-days) was lower at 7.5 ◦C than at the two other temperatures tested. Food conversion efficiency, muscle energy content, and the Fulton condition index were not influenced by temperature, but food intake significantly increased over time at 5.5 ◦C. No clear difference in growth trajectories between sexes was highlighted. Overall, the results suggest that optimal temperature conditions were exceeded at 7.5 ◦C and that any further increase in temperature would significantly decrease survival and impair juvenile growth. With the current deep-water warming trends in the Estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence, recruitment and commercial fishing of Greenland halibut may be impaired in the near future.},

In its simplest form, ice-albedo feedback is thought to be associated with a decrease in the areal cover of snow and ice and a corresponding increase in the surface temperature, further decreasing the areal cover of snow and ice. It is shown that the sea ice-albedo feedback can operate even in multiyear pack ice, without the disappearance of this ice, associated with internal processes occurring within the multiyear ice pack (e.g., duration of the snow cover, ice thickness, ice distribution, lead fraction, and melt pond characteristics).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The strength of the ice-albedo feedback mechanism is compared for several different thermodynamic sea ice models: a new model that includes ice thickness distribution, the Ebert and Curry model, the Maykut and Untersteiner model, and the Semtner level-3 and level-0 models. The climate forcing is chosen to be a perturbation of the surface heat flux, and cloud and water vapor feedbacks are inoperative so that the effects of the sea ice-albedo feedback mechanism can be isolated. The inclusion of melt ponds significantly strengthens the ice-albedo feedback, while the ice thickness distribution decreases the strength of the modeled sea ice-albedo feedback. It is emphasized that accurately modeling present-day sea ice thickness is not adequate for a sea ice parameterization; the correct physical processes must be included so that the sea ice parameterization yields correct sensitivities to external forcing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Heavier and more persistent sea ice provided a buffer against the influence of short-term climate fluctuations. Such recent increases in sea ice/atmospheric interactions lead to revisiting the concept of abrupt change. The Arctic climate is stabilized by a negative radiative feedback, as increased temperatures of the surface and at­ mospheric lose more long wave energy. However, through new shifts in albedo feedback, open ocean areas are absorbing more of the incoming solar heat. Recent multi-year environmental extremes, potential albedo in­ stabilities, and increased sensitivity of sea ice to storms in marginal seas, are overcoming negative radiative feedback, which point to passing impending climatic and ecosystem thresholds. Unless {CO}2 emissions are reduced, further Arctic extremes are expected in the next decades with environmental and societal impacts spreading through the Arctic and beyond.},

A functional response model indicated that predation rates can be reduced by satiation when mean prey density is high or when prey encounters are highly patchy. We then used bioenergetics modeling to estimate the predation rates of individual bass in four lakes during a 16-year period and used stomach content mass in diet samples to evaluate the variability in daily predation rates. Predation rates, expressed as the proportion (p) of the maximum daily consumption rate, were low (mode = 0.3, mean = 0.4). Stomach fullness (s), expressed as the proportion of the stomach fullness associated with the maximum sustainable consumption rate, was highly variable, and 13\% of all bass diets had s {\textgreater} 1, indicating that bass could opportunistically forage at rates exceeding their maximum sustainable rate. The low predation rates and the ability to consume prey at rates exceeding the maximum sustainable rate make it unlikely that satiation was an important constraint on bass predation rates. Thus, satiation effects widely represented in modeling studies may be a rare component in piscivore–prey interactions, while prey behavior may be a more important component governing predation rates.},

We tested whether captive small primates exposed to an experimentally increased frequency of seasonal transitions die sooner than individuals living under natural seasonality. The results show that experiencing one additional season per year increases the mortality hazard by a factor of 3 to 4, whereas the expected number of seasons lived is only slightly impacted by the seasonal rhythm. These results demonstrate that physiological transitions between periods of high and low metabolic activity represent a major mortality risk for seasonal organisms, which has been ignored until now.},

	abstract = {When attacked by a predator, ﬁsh respond with a sudden fast-start motion away from the threat. Although this anaerobically-powered swimming necessitates a recovery phase which is fueled aerobically, little is known about links between escape performance and aerobic traits such as aerobic scope ({AS}) or recovery time after exhaustive exercise. Slower recovery ability or a reduced {AS} could make some individuals less likely to engage in a fast-start response or display reduced performance. Conversely, increased vigilance in some individuals could permit faster responses to an attack but also increase energy demand and prolong recovery after anaerobic exercise. We examined how {AS} and the ability to recover from anaerobic exercise relates to differences in fast-start escape performance in juvenile golden gray mullet at different acclimation temperatures. Individuals were acclimated to either 18, 22, or 26◦C, then measured for standard and maximal metabolic rates and {AS} using intermittent ﬂow respirometry. Anaerobic capacity and the time taken to recover after exercise were also assessed. Each ﬁsh was also ﬁlmed during a simulated attack to determine response latency, maximum speed and acceleration, and turning rate displayed during the escape response. Across temperatures, individuals with shorter response latencies during a simulated attack are those with the longest recovery time after exhaustive anaerobic exercise. Because a short response latency implies high preparedness to escape, these results highlight the trade-off between the increased vigilance and metabolic demand, which leads to longer recovery times in fast reactors. These results improve our understanding of the intrinsic physiological traits that generate inter-individual variability in escape ability, and emphasize that a full appreciation of trade-offs associated with predator avoidance and energy balance must include energetic costs associated with vigilance and recovery from anaerobic exercise.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary explanations of the adaptive value of animal characteristics are often expressed in energetic terms, but unless they are accompanied by demonstrations of limited energy availability, they remain speculative. In this review, we argue that metabolic power budgeting provides easily testable mechanisms through which energetically efficient attributes could become adaptive. Given each organism’s maximal aerobic (and metabolic) capacity, available metabolic power (energy use per unit time) is limited and must be partitioned between different processes. This leads to compromises among the major fitness functions of growth, locomotor activity, and reproductive investment. As examples of such conflicts, we examine the compromise among growth, reproduction, and predator avoidance in scallops, as well as the means whereby thermal limitations on oxygen uptake reflect the geographical distribution limits and associated energetic tradeoffs of temperate zone and polar fishes. These examples show several means whereby the budgeting of aerobic power is implicated in the major fitness trade-offs faced by animals.},

	abstract = {The management of species that occur in low densities is a conservation concern worldwide across taxa with consequences for managers and policymakers. The distribution boundary at the upper extent of fish in North America receives extra attention because stream reaches with fish are managed differently and often have more protections than fishless reaches. Here, we examine the relative reliability of water environmental {DNA} ({eDNA}), polymerase chain reaction ({PCR})-amplified for Coastal Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) to detect the upper extent of fish across streams as a potential management tool compared to standard electrofishing methods. We provide estimates of fish detection probabilities from {eDNA} analyses, and probabilities of detection for both {eDNA} field samples and quantitative {PCR} ({qPCR}) given covariates of habitat characteristics and fish densities from electrofishing. We present a primer and probe based on the cytochrome oxidase I gene using {qPCR} to detect trout {DNA} across water samples from 60 forested streams in the Pacific Northwest, {USA} using high-resolution spatial sampling. In 28\% of streams, the upper extent of fish matches between methods. In over half of the streams, Coastal Cutthroat Trout {eDNA} was detected above the electrofishing last-fish boundary. Although some detections could be attributed to false-positive errors, {eDNA} results extend the upstream, leading edge of fish by 50–250 m from the electrofishing boundary. In 20\% of the streams, detections of last-fish occurred higher in the stream network with electrofishing rather than {eDNA}, but generally by only 50 m. Modeled results revealed that the occurrence of trout {eDNA} was higher in wider-stream locations and that {eDNA} detections occurred at lower electrofishing densities ({\textless}5 trout per 50 linear m). We also showed that three replicate {eDNA} samples were sufficient to capture trout {eDNA} when {eDNA} was present. Although {eDNA} constitutes an effective addition to approaches to delimit the upper extent of fish, its effectiveness depends on previous knowledge of the last-fish boundary to apprise where to start sampling and targeting fish species anticipated to be last-fish. We present evidence that {eDNA} is a valuable tool in investigating fish distributions taking its place alongside traditional high-effort catch–release tools.},

Because of its transparent and flexible nature, R is increasingly used for data management and analysis in the field of ecology. Consequently, job postings targeting candidates with a bachelor's degree and a required knowledge of R have increased over the past ten years. In this paper, we begin by presenting data from the last ten years demonstrating the increase in the use of R, an open-source programming environment, in ecology and its prevalence as a required skill in job descriptions. We then discuss our experiences teaching undergraduates R in two advanced ecology classes using different approaches. One approach, in a course with a field laboratory, focused on collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. The other approach, in a course without a field laboratory, focused on analyzing existing datasets and applying the results to content discussed in the lecture portion of the course. Our experiences determined that each approach had strengths and weaknesses. We recommend that above all, instructors of ecology and related subjects should be encouraged to include R in their coursework. Furthermore, instructors should be aware of the following: Learning R is a separate skill from learning statistics; writing R assignments is a significant time commitment for course preparation; and there is a tradeoff between teaching R and teaching content. Determining how one's course fits into the curriculum and identifying resources outside of the classroom for students’ continued practice will ensure that R training is successful and will extend beyond a one-semester course.},

We investigated the magnitude of this phenomenon and its effect on survival using previously collected mark-recapture data of four reef-associated species. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to examine whether survival varied with release number. For three of four species, survival was signiﬁcantly higher after the second, third, and/or fourth release as compared to the ﬁrst release, perhaps resulting from selection for robust individuals. Repetitive recapture implies that the estimated number of unique released ﬁsh is biased. Increased survival following later releases as compared to the initial release suggests that the number of dead discards may be similarly overestimated. We analysed the sensitivity of stock assessment results to reduced estimates of dead discards using two of our species that had recently been assessed. We found that reduced estimates of dead discards had a modest effect on assessment results but could nonetheless affect the perception of ﬁshery status. Our ﬁndings highlight the need to revise current practices for estimating live and dead discards, either internal or external to stock assessment models.},

	abstract = {Climate change is inducing deep modifications in local communities worldwide as a consequence of individualistic species range shifts. Understanding how complex interaction networks will be reorganized under climate change represents a major challenge in the fields of ecology and biogeography. However, forecasting the potential effects of climate change on local communities, and more particularly on food-web structure, requires the consideration of highly structuring processes, such as trophic interactions. A major breakthrough is therefore expected by combining predictive models integrating habitat selection processes, the physiological limits of marine species and their trophic interactions. In this study, we forecasted the potential impacts of climate change on the local food-web structure of the highly threatened Gulf of Gabes ecosystem located in the south of the Mediterranean Sea. We coupled the climatic envelope and habitat models to an allometric niche food web model, hence taking into account the different processes acting at regional (climate) and local scales (habitat selection and trophic interactions). Our projections under the A2 climate change scenario showed that future food webs would be composed of smaller species with fewer links, resulting in a decrease of connectance, generality, vulnerability and mean trophic level of communities and an increase of the average path length, which may have large consequences on ecosystem functioning. The unified framework presented here, by connecting food-web ecology, biogeography and seascape ecology, allows the exploration of spatial aspects of interspecific interactions under climate change and improves our current understanding of climate change impacts on local marine food webs.},

	abstract = {Climate-driven poleward shifts, leading to changes in species composition and relative abundances, have been recently documented in the Arctic. Among the fastest moving species are boreal generalist fish which are expected to affect arctic marine food web structure and ecosystem functioning substantially. Here, we address structural changes at the food web level induced by poleward shifts via topological network analysis of highly resolved boreal and arctic food webs of the Barents Sea. We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations, thereby changing arctic marine food web structure considerably with implications for ecosystem dynamics and functioning.},

Understanding these impacts is therefore essential for managing ecosystems and sustaining human well-being. Here, we conducted a global synthesis of terrestrial, marine, and freshwater studies to identify key gaps in our knowledge of climate change impacts on food webs and determine whether the areas currently studied are those most likely to be impacted by climate change. We found research suffers from a strong geographic bias, with only 3.5\% of studies occurring in the tropics. Importantly, the distribution of sites sampled under projected climate changes was biased—areas with decreases or large increases in precipitation and areas with low magnitudes of temperature change were under-represented. Our results suggest that understanding of climate change impacts on food webs could be broadened by considering more than two trophic levels, responses in addition to species abundance and biomass, impacts of a wider suite of climatic variables, and tropical ecosystems. Most importantly, to enable better forecasts of biodiversity responses to climate change, we identify critically under-represented geographic regions and climatic conditions which should be prioritized in future research.},

These shifts reassemble food webs and can have dramatic consequences. Compared with species on land, marine species are more sensitive to changing climate but have a greater capacity for colonization. These differences suggest that species cope with climate change at different spatial scales in the two realms and that range shifts across wide spatial scales are a key mechanism at sea.

	abstract = {The Inuit of Qikiqtaaluk (Baffin Island) have developed a deep respect for their natural environment and are able to report not only changes in weather, ice, and natural resources but also changes in their communities as a result of climate change. The objective of this study was to shed light on how the impacts of climate change are currently perceived in the communities of Kanngiqtugaapik, Pangniqtuuq, and Qikiqtarjuaq. In order to construct a shared knowledge base, we conducted qualitative video interviews and participated in a hunting camp with multigenerational and multigender Inuit hunters and fishers. First, Inuit continue to see the world in which they cohabit with other living things, particularly animals, as a world that they cannot control on their own—a world they must adapt to, passing learning from one generation to the next. Second, they report that changes in the ice have been among the major and most important transformations to have occurred in recent decades. Observations made by these local populations also indicate changes in hunted species, with fewer caribou and narwhal, more birds, insects, and fish, including from more southerly regions, and an uncertainty about polar bear populations. Seal hunting remains stable, and this meat is still the most popular and healthy food, physically and psychologically. Third, sociological and economic changes (e.g., lifestyle change, monetary economies, quotas), in addition to environmental changes (e.g., climate change, species change), have had a significant impact on food harvesting activities as well as food consumption in the region. A final perspective concerns the needs of the Qikiqtaaluk communities to further develop collaboration with scientists. This need for partnership is not only perceived as a scientific necessity but also recognized by Inuit as essential to their communities, with some local leaders ready to work toward a fruitful collaboration.},

With continuous weekly observations spanning 7 decades in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island ({USA}), the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography trawl survey provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the influence of climate on the migrations of marine species in the northwest Atlantic. Analyses of the survey observations of 12 species indicated that residence periods have changed by as much as 118 d, with shifts in the timing of both ingress to and egress from the coastal zone. The residence periods of warmwater species expanded while those of cold-water species contracted. Dirichlet regressions fit to the annual presence−absence patterns of each species identified interannual temperature variations, fluctuations in ocean circulation, and long-term warming all as having a significant effect on migration phenology. Additionally, temperature gradients within Narragansett Bay were shown by generalized additive models to cause detectable shifts in local spatial distributions during coastal residency. These novel findings mirror results found in the spatial domain and therefore suggest that the studied species are adapting their spatiotemporal distributions to track their thermal niche in a changing climate. If so, characterizing the spatial and temporal aspects of climate responses across species will be critical to understanding ongoing changes in marine ecosystems and successfully managing the fisheries they support.},

We evaluated the feasibility of using passive acoustic telemetry to monitor ﬁsh welfare in sea-cage aquaculture at an industrial scale, characterizing for the ﬁrst time the diel swimming and distribution patterns of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) at ﬁne-scale. Ten ﬁsh were implanted with acoustic tags equipped with pressure and acceleration sensors, and monitored in a commercial-size sea-cage for a period of 1 month. Overall, ﬁsh exhibited clear differences in day vs. night patterns both on swimming activity and vertical distribution throughout the experiment. Space use increased at night after the implementation of structural environmental enrichment in the sea-cage. Acoustic telemetry may represent an advancement to monitor ﬁsh farming procedures and conditions, helping to promote ﬁsh welfare and product quality.},

We examined activity levels and behavioral patterns of red snapper over natural reefs, oil platforms and submerged ships. Telemetry tags (Sonotronics model {MTT}) that transmitted tri-axial acceleration range, with average depth or average temperature were developed speciﬁcally to monitor red snapper and tested in captive ﬁsh. Wild red snapper were surgically implanted at depth and monitored for 16 months over artiﬁcial and natural reefs. Overall dynamic body acceleration ({ODBA}) as the sum of x, y and z acceleration range (0–0.398 g along each axis) was used to estimate activity levels of red snapper at each reef. Measurements of red snapper indicated that season, diel period, temperature time blocks and reef type had signiﬁcant eﬀects on {ODBA} and depth use. Red snapper were more active during the summer, at night, and during a period of rapid temperature increase. Red snapper were also generally more active and stayed at shallower depths on ships. The increases in activity reported here may be attributed to diﬀering feeding or spawning behaviors on certain reefs. These results suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and diel period heavily inﬂuence red snapper and that they behave diﬀerently on speciﬁc habitat types at certain times. Future eﬀorts to examine the ecological performance of red snapper across reef types should therefore carefully take environmental inﬂuences into account.},

Furthermore, {BIC} can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using {AIC} versus {BIC} for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective.

In a field experiment we caged small and large trout in similar habitats and found that sculpins avoided areas containing trout that were large enough to pose a threat to them, but did not avoid areas containing trout that were small and hence not a threat. In a series of laboratory experiments we found that sculpins showed threat-sensitive predator avoidance when they could assess the predator visually. However, when only chemical cues from the predator were presented, sculpins responded to the predator regardless of its size. Chemical cues seem to function to warn the sculpin that the predator is in the vicinity, but visual cues are needed in order to accurately assess the risk posed by the predator.},

Ecology of Freshwater Fish 2011: 20: 80–91. © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons A/S Abstract – Coastrange sculpin (Cottus aleuticus) have colonised recently deglaciated streams of Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, {USA}, within the last 200 years. Highly cryptic colouration across a marked gradient of stream substrate colours within Glacier Bay could result from physiological (rapid) or morphological (slower) colour change. Laboratory experiments revealed that physiological colour plasticity occurred on the order of minutes, with significant variation in the degree of colour change among individuals and between populations. In contrast, morphological colour plasticity occurred on the order of weeks to months. Experimentally manipulated spectral conditions influenced the magnitude and variance of subsequent physiological colour plasticity. In-stream predation trials revealed significantly more predation attempts on higher background contrast sculpin models, providing evidence that background colour matching has strong fitness consequences. Colour plasticity with apparent fitness consequences occurs at multiple interacting time scales in coastrange sculpin and may play an important role in the colonisation of recently deglaciated streams.},

Three whales went northwest visiting adjacent fjords before moving south, together with the three other whales, along the east coast of Baffin Island. The narwhals arrived on the wintering ground in northern Davis Strait in late October. Speed and range of movements declined once the wintering ground was reached. Dive depths increased from summer to autumn, and reached at least 1,500 m. Late summer and winter kernel home ranges were approximately 3,400 km{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} and 12,000 km{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum}, respectively. The relative abundance of whales on the wintering ground was 936 narwhals.

The resulting coefﬁcients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option—an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data ﬁle—so that the magnitudes of coefﬁcients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

	abstract = {Three flawed practices associated with model averaging coefficients for predictor variables in regression models commonly occur when making multimodel inferences in analyses of ecological data. Model-averaged regression coefficients based on Akaike information criterion ({AIC}) weights have been recommended for addressing model uncertainty but they are not valid, interpretable estimates of partial effects for individual predictors when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables. Multicollinearity implies that the scaling of units in the denominators of the regression coefficients may change across models such that neither the parameters nor their estimates have common scales, therefore averaging them makes no sense. The associated sums of {AIC} model weights recommended to assess relative importance of individual predictors are really a measure of relative importance of models, with little information about contributions by individual predictors compared to other measures of relative importance based on effects size or variance reduction. Sometimes the model-averaged regression coefficients for predictor variables are incorrectly used to make model-averaged predictions of the response variable when the models are not linear in the parameters. I demonstrate the issues with the first two practices using the college grade point average example extensively analyzed by Burnham and Anderson. I show how partial standard deviations of the predictor variables can be used to detect changing scales of their estimates with multicollinearity. Standardizing estimates based on partial standard deviations for their variables can be used to make the scaling of the estimates commensurate across models, a necessary but not sufficient condition for model averaging of the estimates to be sensible. A unimodal distribution of estimates and valid interpretation of individual parameters are additional requisite conditions. The standardized estimates or equivalently the t statistics on unstandardized estimates also can be used to provide more informative measures of relative importance than sums of {AIC} weights. Finally, I illustrate how seriously compromised statistical interpretations and predictions can be for all three of these flawed practices by critiquing their use in a recent species distribution modeling technique developed for predicting Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) distribution in Colorado, {USA}. These model averaging issues are common in other ecological literature and ought to be discontinued if we are to make effective scientific contributions to ecological knowledge and conservation of natural resources.},

	abstract = {Climate-driven poleward shifts, leading to changes in species composition and relative abundances, have been recently documented in the Arctic. Among the fastest moving species are boreal generalist fish which are expected to affect arctic marine food web structure and ecosystem functioning substantially. Here, we address structural changes at the food web level induced by poleward shifts via topological network analysis of highly resolved boreal and arctic food webs of the Barents Sea. We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations, thereby changing arctic marine food web structure considerably with implications for ecosystem dynamics and functioning.},

	abstract = {Large ({\textgreater}458 mm) striped bass (Morone saxatilis) are dominant predators in Chesapeake Bay. In recent years, the Chesapeake Bay stock of striped bass has increased dramatically, raising concerns about their predatory impact and their forage requirements. In response to these concerns and the need for more recent ecological stud­ ies, this investigation was conducted to characterize feeding habits of large striped bass in Chesapeake Bay. Stom­ ach contents from 1225 striped bass from 458 to 1151 mm {TL} were exam­ ined in the spring and fall of 1997 and 1998. Striped bass consumed 52 differ­ ent species of vertebrates and inverte­ brates; however, only a few species of clupeoid and sciaenid ﬁshes dominated diets across both the seasons and size ranges of striped bass examined. Of ﬁnﬁsh species, menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) was the dominant prey in most areas and gizzard shad (Doro­ soma cepedianum) replaced menhaden in importance in lower salinity waters. Spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and other sciaenid ﬁshes and anadromous herrings (Alosa spp.) also contibuted large percentages of striped bass diet. Although pelagic schooling fishes formed the majority of the diet, benthic ﬁshes contributed a higher percentage to the diet than in previous studies of striped bass diet composition.},

In this study, we analyzed stomach contents of common fishes collected from Port Jefferson Harbor, Great South Bay, and Shinnecock Bay between May and October of 2007 and 2008. General diet composition was described by percent by number (\% N), percent by weight (\% W), percent frequency of occurrence (\% O), and percent index of relative importance (\% {IRI}) for seven species: Paralichthys dentatus (Summer Flounder), young-of-the-year ({YOY}) Pomatomus saltatrix (Bluefish), Prionotus evolans (Striped Searobin), Stenotomus chrysops (Scup), Scophthalmus aquosus (Windowpane Flounder), Raja eglanteria (Clearnose Skate), and Morone saxatilis (Striped Bass). Temporal diet composition was estimated for the consistently abundant {YOY} Bluefish, Summer Flounder, and Scup, where most n season {\textgreater}25. Subsampling of large catches of {YOY} Bluefish and Scup led to investigation of diet composition by cluster sampling. Important prey included Crangon sp. (sand shrimp), Cancer irroratus (Rock Crab), and forage fishes. Pseudopleuronectes americanus (Winter Flounder), once a common prey item in stomachs of piscivorous Long Island fishes, contributed ≤ 6.7 \% O and ≤ 1.6 \% W to the diets of Summer Flounder, Striped Searobin, Striped Bass, and {YOY} Bluefish. These changes may be due to shifts in the abundance of prey items or changes in spatial overlap of predator and prey.},

First, the polar night is not a period void of biological activity even though primary production is close to zero, but is rather characterized by a number of processes and interactions yet to be fully understood, including unanticipated high levels of feeding and reproduction in a wide range of taxa and habitats. Second, as more knowledge emerges, it is evident that a coupled physical and biological perspective of the ecosystem will redeﬁne seasonality beyond the ‘‘calendar perspective”. Third, it appears that many organisms may exhibit endogenous rhythms that trigger ﬁtness-maximizing activities in the absence of light-based cues. Indeed a common adaptation appears to be the ability to utilize the dark season for reproduction. This and other processes are most likely adaptations to current environmental conditions and community and trophic structures of the ecosystem, and may have implications for how Arctic ecosystems can change under continued climatic warming.},

During spring 1992 (from April to June), algae in the bottom ice layer and those suspended and sinking in the upper water column (top 15 m) were sampled approximately every 4 days. Ice-bottom chlorophyll a reached a maximum concentration of 160 mg m−2 in mid-May, after which it decreased to lower values. In the water column, chlorophyll a concentrations were low until the period of ice-algal decline (∼0.1 mg m−3), with most biomass in the {\textless}5-μm fraction. In both the suspended and sinking material, large increases of algal biomass occurred at the beginning of June, following the release of ice-algae into the water column. The input of ice-algal derived carbon to the upper water column and the proportions exported through sinking or remaining in suspension were assessed using a carbon budget for the two periods of ice-algal growth and decline. For each period the output terms closely balanced the input. The carbon budget showed that most of the biomass introduced into the upper water column remained suspended ({\textgreater}65\% of total export) and that ice-algae were ingested by under-ice grazers after release from the ice. These results stress the importance of ice algae for pelagic consumers during the early stages of ice melt and show that the transfer of ice algae to higher trophic levels extends beyond the period of maximum algal production in the ice bottom.},

Interannual differences (2- to 4-fold) in the feeding success of fish larvae (percent feeding incidence at length and mean feeding ratio at length) were related to the availability of copepod nauplii Consistent with the match/mismatch hypothesis, the fixity of the spawning season in relation to a variable cycle of prey abundance accounted for the observed variations in feeding success and apparent growth (length at date) of fish larvae. Yet, in this particular ecosystem, a match or mismatch between Arctic cod or sand lance larvae and their prey may depend more on the dynamics of cyclopoid copepods during the previous winter than on the timing of the spring algal blooms.},

	abstract = {Climate influences a population through a variety of processes, including reproduction, growth, migration patterns and phenology. Climate may operate either directly through metabolic and reproductive processes or indirectly through prey, predators, and competitors. One mechanism that may be particularly important, and which is the focus of this review, is the role of climate in affecting the reproductive success of a predator through its effect on the relative timing of food requirement and food availability during early life stages. This principle — the match or mismatch of predators’ requirement with resource availability — originated in the marine literature, where it initially referred to how growth and survival of fish larvae (predator) depends on this production being synchronous with that of their main food items, i.e. early stage zooplankton (prey). Here we review how the match/mismatch hypothesis ({MMH}) is used to describe climate effects on ecological patterns and processes in both marine and terrestrial systems. In addition to studying match/mismatch sensu stricto, we expand on it to include effects of overall production level and the spatial aspect. Possible impacts of climate change on match/mismatch are examined in the context of one of the most apparent effects of global warming: an advancement of spring phenology. As a consequence of different species reacting dissimilarly, even minor changes in climate may invoke non-linear responses unbalancing established patterns of synchrony. All components of a food chain cannot be expected to shift their phenology at the same rate, and thus are unlikely to remain synchronous.},

Consistent with the hypothesis, the spring cohort had almost completely vanished by age 10 days (first feeding stage), while the summer cohort survived well and dominated the population by the end of our sampling in early August. By then, the few surviving spring larvae were on average 5.7 mm longer than summer larvae (18.6 vs. 12.9 mm). A retrospective analysis of ice cover in the polynya (1979 to 2003) indicated that first-feeding larvae of the spring cohort encountered good survival conditions (sea ice {\textless}50\% and {SST} {\textgreater}0 °C) in only 12\% of the years compared with 80\% for the summer cohort.

Despite its ecological importance, spatially explicit studies synthesizing polar cod distributions across research efforts have not previously been conducted in its Pacific range. We used spatial generalized additive models to map the distribution of polar cod by size class and relative to environmental variables. We compiled demersal trawl data from 21 cruises conducted during 2004–2017 in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, and investigated size-specific patterns in distribution to infer movement ecology of polar cod as it develops from juvenile to adult life stages. High abundances of juvenile polar cod (≤ 70 mm) in the northeastern Chukchi Sea and western Beaufort Sea were separated from another region of high abundance in the eastern Beaufort Sea, near the {US} and Canadian border, suggesting possible population structure in the Pacific Arctic. Relating environmental correlates to polar cod abundance demonstrated that temperature and salinity were related to juvenile distribution patterns, while depth was the primary correlate of adult distribution. A comparison of seasonal 2017 abundances of polar cod in the southern Chukchi Sea found low demersal abundance in the spring when compared to the summer. Seasonal differences in polar cod abundance suggest that polar cod migration may follow a classical ‘migration triangle’ route between nursery grounds as juveniles, feeding grounds as subadults, and spawning grounds as adults, in relation to ice cover and seasonal production in the Chukchi Sea.},

When these estimates were combined with proportion of anadromous individuals in partially anadromous populations, marine food sources accounted for 31\%–44\% of Arctic char population productivity and 16\%–26\% of lake trout population productivity.

Here, we test whether these threatened species are simply a random sample of birds, or whether there is something about their biology that predisposes them to extinction. We ask three speciﬁc questions. First, is extinction risk randomly distributed among families ? Second, which families, if any, contain more, or less, threatened species than would be expected by chance ? Third, is variation between taxa in extinction risk associated with variation in either body size or fecundity ? Extinction risk is not randomly distributed among families. The families which contain signiﬁcantly more threatened species than expected are the parrots (Psittacidae), pheasants and allies (Phasianidae), albatrosses and allies (Procellariidae), rails (Rallidae), cranes (Gruidae), cracids (Cracidae), megapodes (Megapodidae) and pigeons (Columbidae). The only family which contains signiﬁcantly fewer threatened species than expected is the woodpeckers (Picidae). Extinction risk is also not distributed randomly with respect to fecundity or body size. Once phylogeny has been controlled for, increases in extinction risk are independently associated with increases in body size and decreases in fecundity. We suggest that this is because low rates of fecundity, which evolved many tens of millions of years ago, predisposed certain lineages to extinction. Low-fecundity populations take longer to recover if they are reduced to small sizes and are, therefore, more likely to go extinct if an external force causes an increase in the rate of mortality, thereby perturbing the natural balance between fecundity and mortality.},

The daily light dose needed for the start of the phytoplankton spring bloom in our experiments agrees well with a recently published critical light intensity found in a field survey of the North Atlantic (around 1.3 mol photons m−2 day−1). Experimental temperature elevation had a strong effect on phytoplankton peak biomass (decreasing with temperature), mean cell size (decreasing with temperature) and on the share of microplankton diatoms (decreasing with temperature). All these changes will lead to poorer feeding conditions for copepod zooplankton and, thus, to a less efficient energy transfer from primary to fish production under a warmer climate.},

	abstract = {Spring phytoplankton blooms contribute a substantial part to annual production, support pelagic and benthic secondary production and inﬂuence biogeochemical cycles in many temperate aquatic systems. Understanding environmental effects on spring bloom dynamics is important for predicting future climate responses and for managing aquatic systems. We analyzed long-term phytoplankton data from one coastal and one offshore station in the Baltic Sea to uncover trends in timing, composition and size of the spring bloom and its correlations to environmental variables. There was a general trend of earlier phytoplankton blooms by 1–2 weeks over the last 20 years, associated with more sunshine and less windy conditions. High water temperatures were associated with earlier blooms of diatoms and dinoﬂagellates that dominate the spring bloom, and decreased diatom bloom magnitude. Overall bloom timing, however, was buffered by a temperature and ice related shift in composition from early blooming diatoms to later blooming dinoﬂagellates and the autotrophic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum. Such counteracting responses to climate change highlight the importance of both general and taxon-speciﬁc investigations. We hypothesize that the predicted earlier blooms of diatoms and dinoﬂagellates as a response to the expected temperature increase in the Baltic Sea might also be counteracted by more clouds and stronger winds. A shift from early blooming and fast sedimenting diatoms to later blooming groups of dinoﬂagellates and M. rubrum at higher temperatures during the spring period is expected to increase energy transfers to pelagic secondary production and decrease spring bloom inputs to the benthic system, resulting in lower benthic production and reduced oxygen consumption.},

Although climate change is significantly impacting species' distributions, few studies have examined associated changes in behavior. Polar bear (Ursus maritimus) subpopulations have varied in their near-term responses to sea ice decline. We examined behavioral responses of two adjacent subpopulations to changes in habitat availability during the annual sea ice minimum using activity data. Location and activity sensor data collected from 1989 to 2014 for 202 adult female polar bears in the Southern Beaufort Sea ({SB}) and Chukchi Sea ({CS}) subpopulations were used to compare activity in three habitat types varying in prey availability: (1) land; (2) ice over shallow, biologically productive waters; and (3) ice over deeper, less productive waters. Bears varied activity across and within habitats with the highest activity at 50-75\% sea ice concentration over shallow waters. On land, {SB} bears exhibited variable but relatively high activity associated with the use of subsistence-harvested bowhead whale carcasses, whereas {CS} bears exhibited low activity consistent with minimal feeding. Both subpopulations had fewer observations in their preferred shallow-water sea ice habitats in recent years, corresponding with declines in availability of this substrate. The substantially higher use of marginal habitats by {SB} bears is an additional mechanism potentially explaining why this subpopulation has experienced negative effects of sea ice loss compared to the still-productive {CS} subpopulation. Variability in activity among, and within, habitats suggests that bears alter their behavior in response to habitat conditions, presumably in an attempt to balance prey availability with energy costs.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {Despite immense concern over amplified warming in the Arctic, physiological research to address related conservation issues for valuable cold-adapted fish, such as the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), is lacking. This crucial knowledge gap is largely attributable to the practical and logistical challenges of conducting sensitive physiological investigations in remote field settings. Here, we used an innovative, mobile aquatic-research laboratory to assess the effects of temperature on aerobic metabolism and maximum heart rate (f Hmax) of upriver migrating Arctic char in the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut in the central Canadian Arctic. Absolute aerobic scope was unchanged at temperatures from 4 to 16◦C, while f Hmax increased with temperature (Q10 = 2.1), as expected. However, f Hmax fell precipitously below 4◦C and it began to plateau above ∼ 16◦C, reaching a maximum at ∼ 19◦C before declining and becoming arrhythmic at ∼ 21◦C. Furthermore, recovery from exhaustive exercise appeared to be critically impaired above 16◦C. The broad thermal range (∼4–16◦C) for increasing f Hmax and maintaining absolute aerobic scope matches river temperatures commonly encountered by migrating Arctic char in this region. Nevertheless, river temperatures can exceed 20◦C during warm events and our results confirm that such temperatures would limit exercise performance and thus impair migration in this species. Thus, unless Arctic char can rapidly acclimatize or alter its migration timing or location, which are both open questions, these impairments would likely impact population persistence and reduce lifetime fitness. As such, future conservation efforts should work towards quantifying and accounting for the impacts of warming, variable river temperatures on migration and reproductive success.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, migratory species are undergoing rapid declines but understanding the factors driving these declines is hindered by missing information about migratory connectivity and the lack of data to quantify environmental processes across the annual cycle. Here, we combined range-wide information about migratory connectivity with global remote-sensing data to quantify the relative importance of breeding and non-breeding environmental processes to persistent long-term population declines of a migratory songbird, the wood thrush (
              Hylocichla mustelina
              ). Consistent with theoretical predictions about population limitation of migratory birds, our results suggest that habitat loss and climate have contributed to the observed declines in wood thrush breeding abundance, yet the relative importance of breeding versus non-breeding factors is population-specific. For example, high-abundance core breeding populations appear to be more limited by habitat loss, whereas low-abundance, peripheral populations appear to be limited by climate-driven seasonal interactions. Further, our analysis indicates that the relative impact of breeding habitat loss is at least three to six times greater than the impact of equivalent non-breeding habitat loss and therefore the steepest regional declines have likely been driven by the loss of breeding habitat. These results underscore the need for population-specific conservation strategies implemented throughout the annual cycle to reverse long-term declines.},

We review recent studies on habitat, migrations and population structure, stressing the importance of electronic tagging results in the modification of our perception of bluefin tuna population dynamics and behaviour. Additionally, we question, from both scientific and management perspectives, the usefulness of the classical stock concept and suggest other approaches, such as Clark's contingent and metapopulation theories. Current biological information confirms that a substantial amount of uncertainty still exists in the understanding of reproduction and growth. In particular, we focus on intriguing issues such as the difference in age-at-maturity between West Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna. Our description of Atlantic bluefin tuna fisheries places today's fishing patterns within the two millennium history of exploitation of this species: we discuss trap fisheries that existed between the 17th and the early 20th centuries; Atlantic fisheries during the 1950s and 1960s; and the consequences of the recent development of the sushi–sashimi market. Finally, we evaluate stock status and management issues since the early 1970s. While important uncertainties remain, when the fisheries history is confronted with evidence from biological and stock-assessment studies, results indicate that Atlantic bluefin tuna has been undergoing heavy overfishing for a decade. We conclude that the current exploitation of bluefin tuna has many biological and economic traits that have led several fish stocks to extreme depletion in the past.},

	abstract = {The endangered black-tailed dusky antechinus (Antechinus arktos) was described in 2014, so most aspects of its ecology are unknown. We examined diet composition and prey selection of A. arktos and a sympatric congener, the northern form of A. stuartii, at two sites in Springbrook National Park. Overall, taxa from 25 invertebrate orders were identiﬁed in the diets from 252 scat samples. Dietary components were similar for each species, but A. arktos consumed a higher frequency and volume of dipteran larvae and Diplopoda, while A. stuartii consumed more Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Orthoptera and Isopoda. Both species of Antechinus had a higher percentage of ‘empty’ scats (devoid of any identiﬁable invertebrate material) in 2014 compared with 2015. The former was a drier year overall. Lower rainfall may have reduced abundance and diversity of arthropod prey, causing both species to supplement their diet with soft-bodied prey items such as earthworms, which are rarely detected in scats. Comparison of prey in scats with invertebrate captures from pitfall traps showed both species to be dietary generalists, despite exhibiting distinct preference and avoidance of certain prey categories. The ability of an endangered generalist marsupial to switch prey may be particularly advantageous considering the anticipated effects of climate change on Gondwanan rainforests during the mid-late 21st century.},

	abstract = {Migration is a ubiquitous life history trait with profound evolutionary and ecological consequences. Recent developments in telemetry and genomics, when combined, can bring significant insights on the migratory ecology of non-model organisms in the wild. Here, we used this integrative approach to document dispersal, gene flow and potential for local adaptation in anadromous Arctic Char from six rivers in the Canadian Arctic. Acoustic telemetry data from 124 tracked individuals indicated asymmetric dispersal, with a large proportion of fish (72\%) tagged in three different rivers migrating up the same short river in the fall. Population genomics data from 6,136 {SNP} markers revealed weak, albeit significant, population differentiation (average pairwise {FST} = 0.011) and asymmetric dispersal was also revealed by population assignments. Approximate Bayesian Computation simulations suggested the presence of asymmetric gene flow, although in the opposite direction to that observed from the telemetry data, suggesting that dispersal does not necessarily lead to gene flow. These observations suggested that Arctic Char home to their natal river to spawn, but may overwinter in rivers with the shortest migratory route to minimize the costs of migration in non-breeding years. Genome scans and genetic-environment associations identified 90 outlier markers putatively under selection, 23 of which were in or near a gene. Of these, at least four were involved in muscle and cardiac function, consistent with the hypothesis that migratory harshness could drive local adaptation. Our study illustrates the power of integrating genomics and telemetry to study migrations in non-model organisms in logistically challenging environments such as the Arctic.},

              p
              is now widely recognized as providing quite limited information about our data, and as being easily misinterpreted. Many biologists are aware of
              p
              's frailties, but less clear about how they might change the way they analyse their data in response. This article highlights and summarizes four broad statistical approaches that augment or replace the
              p
              -value, and that are relatively straightforward to apply. First, you can augment your
              p
              -value with information about how confident you are in it, how likely it is that you will get a similar
              p
              -value in a replicate study, or the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive. Second, you can enhance the information provided by frequentist statistics with a focus on effect sizes and a quantified confidence that those effect sizes are accurate. Third, you can augment or substitute
              p
              -values with the Bayes factor to inform on the relative levels of evidence for the null and alternative hypotheses; this approach is particularly appropriate for studies where you wish to keep collecting data until clear evidence for or against your hypothesis has accrued. Finally, specifically where you are using multiple variables to predict an outcome through model building, Akaike information criteria can take the place of the
              p
              -value, providing quantified information on what model is best. Hopefully, this quick-and-easy guide to some simple yet powerful statistical options will support biologists in adopting new approaches where they feel that the

We assessed the responses of littoral invertebrate communities to changing abiotic conditions in subarctic Swedish lakes with long-term data (1988–2010) and compared the responses of subarctic lakes with those of more southern, hemiboreal lakes. We used a complex systems approach, based on multivariate time-series modelling, and identified dominant and distinct temporal frequencies in the data; that is, we tracked community change at distinct temporal scales. We determined the distribution of functional feeding groups of invertebrates within and across temporal scales. Within and cross-scale distributions of functions have been considered to confer resilience to ecosystems, despite changing environmental conditions. Two patterns of temporal change within the invertebrate communities were identified that were consistent across the lakes. The first pattern was one of monotonic change associated with changing abiotic lake conditions. The second was one of showing fluctuation patterns largely unrelated to gradual environmental change. Thus, two dominant and distinct temporal frequencies (temporal scales) were present in all lakes analysed. Although the contribution of individual feeding groups varied between subarctic and hemiboreal lakes, they shared overall similar functional attributes (richness, evenness, diversity) and redundancies of functions within and between the observed temporal scales. This highlights similar resilience characteristics in subarctic and hemiboreal lakes. Synthesis and applications. The effects of global change can be particularly strong at a single scale in ecosystems. Over time, this can cause monotonic change in communities and eventually lead to a loss of important ecosystem services upon reaching a critical threshold. Dynamics at other spatial or temporal scales can be unrelated to environmental change. The relative ‘intactness’ of these scales that are unaffected by global change and the persistence of functions at those scales may safeguard the whole system from the potential loss of functions at the scale at which global change impacts can be substantial. Thus, an understanding of scale-specific processes provides managers with a realistic assessment of vulnerabilities and the relative resilience of ecosystems to environmental change. Explicit consideration of ‘intact’ and ‘affected’ scales in analyses of global change impacts provides opportunities to tailor more specific management plans.},

	abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

	abstract = {Mobile consumers often match their movements to short-term resource pulses. In the Arctic, seasonal ice breakup facilitates an ephemeral productivity pulse exploited by marine consumers. The migration of anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) to marine waters occurs around the beginning of ice breakup, but the precise timing of movement is equivocal and current evidence is conflicting. To investigate the migratory timing of Arctic char, 34 individuals were tagged with acoustic telemetry transmitters within Tremblay Sound, Nunavut, Canada in two successive years. All tagged fish entered the marine environment before the coastal ice-off date (mean ± {SE}: 7.56 ± 0.56 days). Further movement metrics revealed that char utilized much of the sound before the ice-off date, with only slightly higher mean home ranges (0.3 km2 larger) and residency indices (by {\textasciitilde} 0.05) during the period following the ice-off date than prior. Such entry and use of marine waters prior to ice breakup may impart energetic benefits to early migrants, maximizing exploitation of the short, anticipated pulse of productivity. The current study provides a unique example of resource tracking that could confer heightened fitness to a marine consumer in the rapidly warming high Arctic.},

	abstract = {Interactions between animals structure food webs and regulate ecosystem function and productivity. Quantifying subsurface behavioural interactions among marine organisms is challenging, but technological advances are promoting novel opportunities. Here, we present a framework to estimate when there is a high likelihood that aquatic animal subsurface interactions occur and test for a movement-related behavioural response to those interactions over short temporal scales (days) using a novel multi-sensor biologging package on a large marine predator, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus). We deployed a recoverable biologging package combining a {VEMCO} Mobile Transceiver ({VMT}), accelerometer and a temperature–depth tag to quantitatively assess fine-scale behaviour during detection events, that is when sharks carrying the novel {VMT} package ({animalR}, n = 3) detected sharks independently tagged with transmitters in the system ({animalT}, n = 29). Concurrently, we developed simulations to estimate the distances between {animalR} and {animalT} by accounting for their swim speed, the estimated detection efficiency of the {VMT} and the number of consecutive transmissions recorded. Accelerometer-derived activity indices were then used as a means to test for response to potential interactions when animals are expected to be in close proximity. Based on this approach, the three {VMT}-equipped Greenland sharks exhibited higher body acceleration and greater depth changes during detections, suggesting a potential behavioural response to the presence of other sharks. A generalized additive model indicated a moderate increasing relationship in activity associated with a greater number of {animalT} detections. Through the proposed framework, detection events with varying probabilities of interaction likelihoods can be derived and those data isolated and explicitly tested using acceleration data to quantify behavioural interactions. Through inputting known parameters for a species of interest, the framework presented is applicable for all aquatic taxa and can guide future study design.},

	abstract = {Animals that occupy temperate and polar regions have specialized traits that help them survive in harsh, highly seasonal environments. One particularly important adaptation is seasonal coat colour ({SCC}) moulting. Over 20 species of birds and mammals distributed across the northern hemisphere undergo complete, biannual colour change from brown in the summer to completely white in the winter. But as climate change decreases duration of snow cover, seasonally winter white species (including the snowshoe hare Lepus americanus, Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus and willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus) become highly contrasted against dark snowless backgrounds. The negative consequences of camouflage mismatch and adaptive potential is of high interest for conservation. Here we provide the first comprehensive review across birds and mammals of the adaptive value and mechanisms underpinning {SCC} moulting. We found that across species, the main function of {SCC} moults is seasonal camouflage against snow, and photoperiod is the main driver of the moult phenology. Next, although many underlying mechanisms remain unclear, mammalian species share similarities in some aspects of hair growth, neuroendocrine control, and the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on moult phenology. The underlying basis of {SCC} moults in birds is less understood and differs from mammals in several aspects. Lastly, our synthesis suggests that due to limited plasticity in {SCC} moulting, evolutionary adaptation will be necessary to mediate future camouflage mismatch and a detailed understanding of the {SCC} moulting will be needed to manage populations effectively under climate change.},

In the absence of adaptive response, we show that these mortality costs would result in strong population-level declines by the end of the century. However, natural selection acting on wide individual variation in molt phenology might enable evolutionary adaptation to camouflage mismatch. We conclude that evolutionary rescue will be critical for hares and other colour molting species to keep up with climate change.},

	abstract = {During the course of the last century, populations of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. have undergone dramatic declines in abundance across their biogeographic range, leading to debate about the relative roles of climatic warming and overfishing in driving these changes. In this chapter, we describe the geographic distributions of this important predator of North Atlantic ecosystems and document extensive evidence for limitations of spatial movement and local adaptation from population genetic markers and electronic tagging. Taken together, this evidence demonstrates that knowledge of spatial population ecology is critical for evaluating the effects of climate change and commercial harvesting. To explore the possible effects of climate change on cod, we first describe thermal influences on individual physiology, growth, activity and maturation. We then evaluate evidence that temperature has influenced population-level processes including direct effects on recruitment through enhanced growth and activity, and indirect effects through changes to larval food resources. Although thermal regimes clearly define the biogeographic range of the species, and strongly influence many aspects of cod biology, the evidence that population declines across the North Atlantic are strongly linked to fishing activity is now overwhelming. Although there is considerable concern about low spawning stock biomasses, high levels of fishing activity continues in many areas. Even with reduced fishing effort, the potential for recovery from low abundance may be compromised by unfavourable climate and Allee effects. Current stock assessment and management approaches are reviewed, alongside newly advocated methods for monitoring stock status and recovery. However, it remains uncertain whether the rebuilding of cod to historic population sizes and demographic structures will be possible in a warmer North Atlantic.},

We digitized extensive historical fisheries data from paper charts in {UK} government archives and combined these with contemporary data to a time-series spanning 1913–2012 (excluding both World Wars). New analysis of old data revealed that the current distribution pattern of cod – mostly in the deeper, northern- and north-easternmost parts of the North Sea – is almost opposite to that during most of the Twentieth Century – mainly concentrated in the west, off England and Scotland. Statistical analysis revealed that the deepening, northward shift is likely attributable to warming; however, the eastward shift is best explained by fishing pressure, suggestive of significant depletion of the stock from its previous stronghold, off the coasts of England and Scotland. These spatial patterns were confirmed for the most recent 3½ decades by data from fisheries-independent surveys, which go back to the 1970s. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of both climate change and fishing pressure for our understanding of changing distributions of commercially exploited fish.},

            The distributional response of marine fishes to climate warming would be expected to be very different than that of homeothermic birds and mammals, due both to more direct thermal effects on poikilothermic fish physiology and on reduced habitat fragmentation. In this study, we use a combination of linear models and graphical tools to quantify three-dimensional distribution shifts in 82 fish species caught in 5390 standardized groundfish survey tows over a 22-year time frame in the highly-productive sub-Arctic waters around Iceland. Over a 1 °C range, temperature significantly modified the distributional centroids of 72\% of all fish species, but had relatively little effect on diversity. Most of the geographic shifts were to the northwest, and there was no overall tendency to move to deeper waters. A doubling of species abundance significantly influenced the distribution of 62\% of species, but lacked the poleward orientation observed with temperature increases. Stenothermal species, those near their upper or lower thermal limits, and those with restricted spatial ranges were most likely to shift their distribution in response to climate warming, while deepwater species were not. A 2–3 °C warming of marine waters seems likely to produce large-scale changes in the location of many sub-Arctic fisheries.},

	abstract = {Interspecific interactions may be altered as a result of poleward species range shifts caused by climate change. In recent decades, Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, in the Canadian Arctic, has undergone concurrent increases in the availability of the forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) and the number of migratory harp seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus) during the open-water period; however, the impacts of these changes on endemic Arctic species, such as ringed seals (Pusa hispida), have received little attention. We coupled stomach contents with stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) of muscle and liver to determine the extent of potential competition between ringed seals (n = 91) and harp seals (n = 39) in Cumberland Sound. Isotopic niche breadth was greater for ringed seals (95\% ellipse: 10.08‰2) than for harp seals (95\% ellipse: 8.00‰2), and harp seal isotopic niche overlapped more with ringed seal isotopic niche than vice versa, suggesting asymmetrical competition potential. Although there was high overlap in isotopic niche breadth (range 50.3–91.0\%) and prey species consumed (Schoener’s Index 0.60), stomach content analysis revealed differences in prey species proportions and size composition, thereby reducing the degree of realized niche overlap. Harp seals consumed a higher biomass of fish (66.7\%) than did ringed seals (31.9\%), and harp seals also consumed larger capelin (64–200 mm), polar cod (Boreogadus saida; 28–194 mm), and Liparidae (55–115 mm) than ringed seals (63–154 mm, 20–189 mm, and 16–128 mm, respectively). With climate change and range shifts predicted to continue into the future, our results provide an important baseline for future studies examining interspecific interactions.},

	abstract = {Light is a central driver of biological processes and systems. Receding sea ice changes the lightscape of high-latitude oceans and more light will penetrate into the sea. This affects bottom-up control through primary productivity and top-down control through vision-based foraging. We model effects of sea-ice shading on visual search to develop a mechanistic understanding of how climate-driven sea-ice retreat affects predator–prey interactions. We adapt a prey encounter model for ice-covered waters, where prey-detection performance of planktivorous fish depends on the light cycle. We use hindcast sea-ice concentrations (past 35 years) and compare with a future no-ice scenario to project visual range along two south–north transects with different sea-ice distributions and seasonality, one through the Bering Sea and one through the Barents Sea. The transect approach captures the transition from sub-Arctic to Arctic ecosystems and allows for comparison of latitudinal differences between longitudes. We find that past sea-ice retreat has increased visual search at a rate of 2.7\% to 4.2\% per decade from the long-term mean; and for high latitudes, we predict a 16-fold increase in clearance rate. Top-down control is therefore predicted to intensify. Ecological and evolutionary consequences for polar marine communities and energy flows would follow, possibly also as tipping points and regime shifts. We expect species distributions to track the receding ice-edge, and in particular expect species with large migratory capacity to make foraging forays into high-latitude oceans. However, the extreme seasonality in photoperiod of high-latitude oceans may counteract such shifts and rather act as a zoogeographical filter limiting poleward range expansion. The provided mechanistic insights are relevant for pelagic ecosystems globally, including lakes where shifted distributions are seldom possible but where predator–prey consequences would be much related. As part of the discussion on photoperiodic implications for high-latitude range shifts, we provide a short review of studies linking physical drivers to latitudinal extent.},

Previous studies show that variability is introduced into projected distributions through alternative datasets and modelling procedures. However, a multi-model approach to assess biogeographic shifts at the global scale is still rarely applied, particularly in the marine environment. Here, we apply three commonly used {SDMs} ({AquaMaps}, Maxent, and the Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model) to assess the global patterns of change in species richness, invasion, and extinction intensity in the world oceans. We make species-speciﬁc projections of distribution shift using each {SDM}, subsequently aggregating them to calculate indices of change across a set of 802 species of exploited marine ﬁsh and invertebrates. Results indicate an average poleward latitudinal shift across species and {SDMs} at a rate of 15.5 and 25.6 km decade21 for a low and high emissions climate change scenario, respectively. Predicted distribution shifts resulted in hotspots of local invasion intensity in high latitude regions, while local extinctions were concentrated near the equator. Speciﬁcally, between 108N and 108S, we predicted that, on average, 6.5 species would become locally extinct per 0.58 latitude under the climate change emissions scenario Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. Average invasions were predicted to be 2.0 species per 0.58 latitude in the Arctic Ocean and 1.5 species per 0.58 latitude in the Southern Ocean. These averaged global hotspots of invasion and local extinction intensity are robust to the different {SDM} used and coincide with high levels of agreement.},

	abstract = {Animal migrations are costly and are often characterized by high predation risk for individuals. Three of the most oft-assumed mechanisms for reducing risk for migrants are swamping predators with high densities, specific timing of migrations and increased body size. Assessing the relative importance of these mechanisms in reducing predation risk particularly for migrants is generally lacking due to the difficulties in tracking the fate of individuals and population-level characteristics simultaneously. We used acoustic telemetry to track migration behaviour and survival of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) smolts released over a wide range of conspecific outmigration densities in a river associated with poor survival. The landscape was indeed high risk; smolt survival was poor (˜68\%) over 13·5 km of river examined even though migration was rapid (generally {\textless}48 h). Our results demonstrate that smolts largely employ swamping of predators to reduce predation risk. Increased densities of co-migrant conspecifics dramatically improved survival of smolts. The strong propensity for nocturnal migration resulted in smolts pausing downstream movements until the next nightfall, greatly increasing relative migration durations for smolts that could not traverse the study area in a single night. Smolt size did not appear to impact predation risk, potentially due to unique characteristics of the system or our inability to tag the entire size range of outmigrants. Movement behaviours were important in traversing this high-risk landscape and provide rare evidence for swamping to effectively reduce individual predation risk.},

The sentinel monitoring framework provides a tool for initial interpretation of adult fish surveys and description of priority areas for subsequent studies to allow identification of the mechanism of impact. Subsequent, focused, follow-up studies are required to identify the stressor(s) once the impact mechanism has been identified. Response pattern separation requires information from the sampled fish population including age structure, energy expenditure and energy storage. The patterns represent characteristic responses to changes in food availability, adult mortality, recruitment failure and metabolic disruption. The framework requires the identification and appropriate sampling of comparable reference sites, but the sentinel monitoring framework has proved to be a useful tool in preliminary trials, and should provide a focal point for cumulative effects studies using fish populations.},

Three recent approaches to predictions in the scientific literature are as follows: (1) extrapolation of sea ice volume data, (2) assuming several more rapid loss events such as 2007 and 2012, and (3) climate model projections. Time horizons for a nearly sea ice-free summer for these three approaches are roughly 2020 or earlier, 2030 ± 10 years, and 2040 or later. Loss estimates from models are based on a subset of the most rapid ensemble members. It is not possible to clearly choose one approach over another as this depends on the relative weights given to data versus models. Observations and citations support the conclusion that most global climate model results in the {CMIP}5 archive are too conservative in their sea ice projections. Recent data and expert opinion should be considered in addition to model results to advance the very likely timing for future sea ice loss to the first half of the 21st century, with a possibility of major loss within a decade or two.},

This study used carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotopes ({SIs}) and stomach content analysis ({SCA}) to assess shorthorn sculpin trophic position ({TP}), carbon sources, dietary specialization and prey selection, and the significance of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) in their diet across body size and multiple years. Sculpin {TP} increased with body size [range = 4.0 ± 0.1 ({\textless} 20 cm) to 4.6 ± 0.2 ({\textgreater} 25 cm)] and was consistent with {SCA}; smaller individuals fed predominantly on invertebrates while larger fed more on fishes. Shorthorn sculpin had high \% reliance on pelagic resources (α) for a benthic fish, from 0.62 ± 0.05 to 0.63 ± 0.06, thus coupling benthic and pelagic sources. Dietary specialization based on {SIs} in liver and muscle occurred in all size groups, and along with {TP} and niche width varied between years, generally increasing with fish found in {SCA}. The presence of polar cod, absent two of the four study years, did not significantly affect any dietary metrics measured in shorthorn sculpin, and cannibalism appears to have had a greater impact on shorthorn sculpin trophic ecology. This study demonstrates that shorthorn sculpin are an important secondary to tertiary consumer in nearshore Arctic marine habitats due to coupling multiple trophic pathways, demonstrating plasticity in diet between years, and exploiting an array of prey across size ranges.},

The two species had almost identical diets, feeding primarily on benthic invertebrates and selecting the same prey species. There was no strong segregation in the diel feeding rhythms of the two species, although the salmon parr consumed a large proportion of their food at night during August and September. The results suggest that the two species compete for food, and that interspecific competition for limited food resources may explain the low production of Atlantic salmon in this river. The observation of a high degree of dietary overlap between the sculpin and the salmon parr contrasts with expectation of interactive segregation. Further, the findings conflict with general niche and competition theories, being inconsistent with the competitive exclusion principle.},

A functional response model indicated that predation rates can be reduced by satiation when mean prey density is high or when prey encounters are highly patchy. We then used bioenergetics modeling to estimate the predation rates of individual bass in four lakes during a 16-year period and used stomach content mass in diet samples to evaluate the variability in daily predation rates. Predation rates, expressed as the proportion (p) of the maximum daily consumption rate, were low (mode = 0.3, mean = 0.4). Stomach fullness (s), expressed as the proportion of the stomach fullness associated with the maximum sustainable consumption rate, was highly variable, and 13\% of all bass diets had s {\textgreater} 1, indicating that bass could opportunistically forage at rates exceeding their maximum sustainable rate. The low predation rates and the ability to consume prey at rates exceeding the maximum sustainable rate make it unlikely that satiation was an important constraint on bass predation rates. Thus, satiation effects widely represented in modeling studies may be a rare component in piscivore–prey interactions, while prey behavior may be a more important component governing predation rates.},

Consequently, in ectotherms, muscle function and feeding kinematics can be altered by temperature. This study investigated the effect of decreasing temperature on the feeding kinematics of the northern most labrid in the Western Atlantic. During winter, cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus) enter a state of extended torpor in order to conserve energy when water temperatures drop below {\textasciitilde}10°C. We hypothesized that feeding kinematics would be slower at lower temperatures especially those associated with torpor (≤10°C). Additionally, we hypothesized that prey type will elicit different feeding behaviors. Feeding events on sandworms and Asian shore crabs were recorded at 5, 10, 15 and 20°C. Fish held at 5°C had slower opening and closing jaw velocities while using more ram than the other temperature treatments. No differences were detected between prey types. For both prey types, the temperature treatment which consistently induced torpor (5°C) slowed oral jaw movements, which likely forced cunner to rely more on ram than suction to capture prey. Torpor temperatures appeared to have less of an effect on feeding than on metabolic rate, steady swimming capabilities and muscle function, suggesting some compensatory mechanisms of feeding musculature in cunner. Temperature can have profound impacts on fitness‐related activities in fishes. We found that, when exposed to temperatures that induce extended torpor, cunner feeding kinematics slow significantly. This result could limit their feeding success when temperatures drop below 10°C. Furthermore, torpor temperatures appeared to have less of an effect on feeding than on metabolic rate, steady swimming capabilities and muscle function, suggesting some compensatory mechanisms of feeding musculature in cunner.},

	abstract = {In the past two decades the number of researchers using biotelemetry to examine fish behaviour and survival has increased considerably. Associated with this has been a significant amount of literature on the effects of the transmitters on the measures under consideration. Despite this, some researchers still rely on a general rule of thumb, “the 2\% rule”, to indicate that the tagging protocol did not affect the results of a study. While it is clearly important to minimise the size of a transmitter and disturbance to a fish, such a general rule does little to advance our understanding of tag effects and may even hamper our ability to effectively study fish behaviour. This note will focus on the size specific effects of tags on fish and presents some recent results along with suggestions for future evaluations. We conclude that there is no generally applicable ‘rule’ for tag/fish size relationship and that the appropriate maximum relationship is driven by the specific study objectives, the tagging method and the species/life stage involved.},

	abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is used to quantify fish movement, ecology, and habitat use and can contribute to assessing the success of species supplementation. In this field, a better understanding of the effects of tag burden (or the impact of an acoustic telemetry tag, which is related to the ratio of tag weight to body weight) is critical to ensure postrelease monitoring. Research on the effects of acoustic tag burden on imperiled fishes at different ontogenic stages, such as juvenile Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens, is limited. Our study provides key information for the selection of the largest acoustic tag with the greatest battery life possible (taking into account tag burden) to monitor the release success and movements of juvenile Lake Sturgeon stocked for reintroduction. We characterized tag burden effects by examining survival, {TL}, weight, Fulton's condition factor, and swim performance of individuals. We examined four groups of fish: control (anesthetized and no acoustic tag inserted; n = 24), sham control (anesthetized with incision sutured but no acoustic tag inserted; n = 24), Vemco V8 acoustic tag (2.0 g in air; n = 24), and Vemco V9 tag (4.4 g in air; n = 24). Acoustic tags were inserted into anesthetized fish, and the incision was sutured; tag burden (mean ± {SE}) ranged from 2.2 ± 0.06\% to 4.6 ± 0.10\% of total body weight. Results showed that the two tag burden treatments had no significant effects on growth or survival (compared to both control groups) across a 114-d study period and that critical swim speed at 12–20 d postsurgery was not significantly impacted by increasing tag burden. Because neither of the acoustic tag sizes had significant deleterious effects on the metrics studied, we recommend using a larger V9 tag (i.e., the most powerful tag with the longest battery life) for postrelease monitoring of reintroduced juvenile Lake Sturgeon.},

Ecosystems today exhibit little of the abundance and complexity found in the past, and populations of over-fished species have declined dramatically world-wide, yet historical evidence has been difficult to assimilate into complex ecosystem models. Here, we look to the testimony of Gulf of Maine fishermen for insights on the abundance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and the environment that once supported such large numbers of them. Using logbook data from Frenchman’s Bay, Maine, and other New England communities at the time of the Civil War, we estimate cod landings in the Gulf of Maine in 1861, establish a population structure for cod at that time, and map the geographical distribution of fishing effort of a fleet that minimized risk and cut expenses by fishing inshore where cod and bait species were plentiful. Log entries list the pelagic and bottom-dwelling invertebrate species these fishermen used for bait, when and how they acquired it, and what species they looked for in the water to signify the presence of cod. Ranked descriptions of both cod and bait abundance were found to be statistically significant indicators of cod catch. Frenchman’s Bay fishermen 140 years ago provided a minimum set of ecosystem requirements for abundant cod, conditions that may inform management plans aimed at restoring both the species and the Gulf of Maine marine ecosystem.},

Generalized additive models are developed to quantify relationships between fish biomass and the external factors of fishing pressure and climate change. Fishing pressure proved to be the main driver of sharp declines in demersal fish stocks, with high-value species being replaced by low-value ones over time. Abrupt decreases in fish biomass during the years of 1993 and 1998 correspond to El Niño events, with climate change possibly the main driver of proportional representation of pelagic species in fisheries trawl catch. The need to differentiate impacts of fishing and environmental drivers on fish species with different life history strategies is stressed to better understand fish community dynamics.},

We derive a simpliﬁed risk analysis for aggregate ﬁsh communities as a preliminary tool to identify priorities for further detailed assessment. Because some of the largest observed rates of sea surface temperature increase are on the northeast {US} continental shelf, we focused on climate change-driven risks to marine communities in this region. We evaluated climate vulnerability for six communities across two ecosystems: both commercial and non-commercial demersal ﬁsh, pelagic ﬁsh, and benthic invertebrates in the Gulf of Maine ({GOM}) and Mid-Atlantic bight ({MAB}). We ﬁrst evaluated the probability that anticipated climate changes (e.g. warming water, decreased salinity, increased acidity, altered boundary currents) would occur in these regions, and rated the potential severity of change over the next 10 years. Then, we evaluated the sensitivity of each biological community in each region using 12 attributes (e.g. habitat and prey speciﬁcity, temperature and acidity sensitivity, larval dispersal, adult mobility, population productivity, etc.). Exposure to the key climate risks was related to community sensitivity in each region for an overall assessment of climate vulnerability. Climate risks from increased surface water temperature, sea level rise, and earlier spring were rated moderate to high in both regions, with additional moderate to high risks in the {GOM} from increased bottom temperature, stratiﬁcation, and river inputs. Benthic invertebrates were rated most sensitive, with demersals intermediate and pelagics lowest. Two {MAB} communities were rated more sensitive than corresponding {GOM} communities, but greater short-term climate risks in the {GOM} indicated increased exposure for {GOM} communities. Overall, this simple analysis may help prioritize short-term regional climate risk management action, thus addressing key conditions related to ﬁshery ﬂuctuations beyond ﬁshing itself.},

The Junk Food Hypothesis proposes that high-lipid prey should produce better reproductive performance by seabirds. In the Gulf of Maine, changes in the forage fish community followed rapid warming post-2005 and included a decline in high-lipid Atlantic herring Clupea harengus. We studied 3 species of alcid (Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica, razorbill Alca torda, common murre Uria aalge) over 23 yr at 3 colonies to assess changes in chick diet and its relationships with reproductive success. Puffin and razorbill chick diet changed over time; puffin diet was highly variable taxonomically, whereas razorbill diets were more consistent, showing proportional changes within fewer taxa. For puffins and razorbills, herring was replaced by sand lance Ammodytes spp. and other taxa with lower energy density. Puffins did not require high-lipid fish to breed successfully, but diet –reproduction relationships became unpredictable following extremely warm winters (2013 and 2016). Razorbills and murres provisioning with low-lipid fish showed reduced chick condition and breeding success. We concluded that razorbills and murres need higher-quality diets than puffins, which more frequently exploited lower-lipid food during food shortages. However, puffin reproductive output was much more vulnerable to ocean warming owing to their longer breeding season and more varied diet. Different responses of closely-related species to changes in prey are driven by differences in chick-development strategies with clear implications for using seabirds as environmental indicators.},

	abstract = {Climate‐driven warming has both social and ecological effects on marine fisheries. While recent changes due to anthropogenic global warming have been documented, similar basin‐wide changes have occurred in the past due to natural temperature fluctuations. Here, we document the effects of rapidly changing water temperatures along the United States' east coast using observations from fisheries newspapers during a warming phase (1945–1951) and subsequent cooling phase (1952–1960) of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which we compared to similar recent observations of warming waters (1998–2017). Historical warming and cooling events affected the abundance of species targeted by fishing, the prevalence of novel and invasive species, and physical access to targeted species. Fishing communities viewed historical cooling waters twice as negatively as they did warming waters (72\% vs. 35\% of observations). Colder waters were associated with a decrease in fishing opportunity due to storminess, while warming waters were associated with the potential for new fisheries. In contrast, recent warming waters were viewed as strongly negative by fishing communities (72\% of observations), associated with disease, reductions in abundances of target species, and shifts in distributions across jurisdictional lines. This increasing perception that warming negatively affects local fisheries may be due to an overall reduction of opportunity in fisheries over the past half century, an awareness of the relative severity of warming today, larger changes in American culture, or a combination of these factors. Negative perceptions of recent warming waters' effects on fisheries suggest that fishing communities are currently finding the prospect of climate adaptation difficult.},

The equilibrium yield (maximum sustainable yield, {MSY}) and biomass at {MSY} ({BMSY}) levels for the summed single-species production model reference points exceeded the aggregate model results by 28.0 and 27.5\%, respectively. Biological interactions such as predation and competition are potential reasons for differences between the aggregate and summed results. Not accounting for biological interactions may result in overly optimistic predictions of long-term sustainable yield and unrealistically high estimates of {BMSY}. We found high concordance between single-species production model reference points and results from a range of other estimation methods employed in assessment of these species, suggesting that the results from the aggregate production model analyses are not artifacts related to model type. Tests for the effect of environmental variables, including the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ({AMO}) index, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation ({NAO}) index, and the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature ({ERSST}) series suggested possible effects of the {NAO} at a lag of 0 and the {ERSST} at a lag of 2 yr based on crosscorrelation analyses. However, further tests proved inconclusive when the covariates were introduced into an extended surplus production model. Given the potential shifts in productivity that can accompany climate change, this issue should be periodically re-evaluated, and, where appropriate, a more dynamic approach to setting reference points should be pursued.},

The magnitude and rate of response to these pressures are species-specific and depend on each individual species’ behavior, physiology and life histories. Thus, species assemblages can be expected to change as a result of the sum of each individual species’ response. In previous studies, distinct species assemblages have been identified in each of the 4 subregions by which the {NES} {LME} has traditionally been assessed: Mid-Atlantic Bight ({MAB}), Southern New England ({SNE}), Georges Bank ({GB}), and Gulf of Maine ({GOM}). In this study, we confirm that each subregion has a distinct species assemblage, but found that those assemblages are shifting over time. The shift appears to be towards species that prefer warmer water. The result is a species assemblage within each subregion that more closely resembles the historic assemblage found in the adjacent subregion to the south. These shifts have occurred in response to a combination of both fishing and climate, and are highly nonlinear. Therefore, current reductions in fishing pressure may not be adequate to return the system to a more historic species assemblage.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Northeast Continental Shelf marine ecosystem has warmed much faster than the global ocean and it is expected that this enhanced warming will continue through this century. Complex bathymetry and ocean circulation in this region have contributed to biases in global climate model simulations of the Shelf waters. Increasing the resolution of these models results in reductions in the bias of future climate change projections and indicates greater warming than suggested by coarse resolution climate projections. Here, we used a high-resolution global climate model and historical observations of species distributions from a trawl survey to examine changes in the future distribution of suitable thermal habitat for various demersal and pelagic species on the Shelf. Along the southern portion of the shelf (Mid-Atlantic Bight and Georges Bank), a projected 4.1 °C (surface) to 5.0 °C (bottom) warming of ocean temperature from current conditions results in a northward shift of the thermal habitat for the majority of species. While some southern species like butterﬁsh and black sea bass are projected to have moderate losses in suitable thermal habitat, there are potentially signiﬁcant increases for many species including summer ﬂounder, striped bass, and Atlantic croaker. In the north, in the Gulf of Maine, a projected 3.7 °C (surface) to 3.9 °C (bottom) warming from current conditions results in substantial reductions in suitable thermal habitat such that species currently inhabiting this region may not remain in these waters under continued warming. We project a loss in suitable thermal habitat for key northern species including Acadian redﬁsh, American plaice, Atlantic cod, haddock, and thorney skate, but potential gains for some species including spiny dogﬁsh and American lobster. We illustrate how changes in suitable thermal habitat of important commercially ﬁshed species may impact local ﬁshing communities and potentially impact major ﬁshing ports along the U.S. Northeast Shelf. Given the complications of multiple drivers including species interactions and ﬁshing pressure, it is difﬁcult to predict exactly how species will shift. However, observations of species distribution shifts in the historical record under ocean warming suggest that temperature will play a primary role in inﬂuencing how species fare. Our results provide critical information on the potential for suitable thermal habitat on the U.S. Northeast Shelf for demersal species in the region, and may contribute to the development of ecosystem-based ﬁsheries management strategies in response to climate change.},

	abstract = {Climate change is impacting fisheries globally, posing both risks and opportunities to those dependent on marine resources. Understanding how fishers perceive climate change, and what factors shape these perceptions, can provide insights into behavioural intentions and support required for climate change focused strategies and management. This study interviewed demersal fishers from a south-west {UK} fishing port to explore: 1) the future risks fishers identified that may affect their business and wider industry; 2) fishers’ beliefs and risk perceptions relating to climate change; and 3) the factors influencing these perceptions. Fishers identified a number of envi­ ronmental, socio-economic and fisheries governance risks but climate change was rarely mentioned. While fishers overall had low risk perceptions of climate change, these perceptions were heterogeneous across the sample. Climate change scepticism and a high perceived selfefficacy to adapt to climate change were associated with lower risk perceptions. These findings provide new insights into how fishers perceive climate change and, importantly, greater under­ standing of the possible drivers of such perceptions. Findings suggest that undertaking climateawareness raising initiatives in isolation to support adaptation strategies could be limited in success. Instead, wider focus should be applied to removing barriers to adaptation, managing wider risks and incorporating fishers into decision making to effectively support and motivate fishers’ adaptation.},

	abstract = {In ecosystems that are strongly structured by predation, reducing top predator abundance can alter several lower trophic levels—a process known as a trophic cascade. A persistent trophic cascade also fits the definition of a regime shift. Such ‘trophic cascade regime shifts' have been reported in a few pelagic marine systems—notably the Black Sea, Baltic Sea and eastern Scotian Shelf—raising the question of how common this phenomenon is in the marine environment. We provide a general methodology for distinguishing top-down and bottom-up effects and apply this methodology to time series from these three ecosystems. We found evidence for top-down forcing in the Black Sea due primarily to gelatinous zooplankton. Changes in the Baltic Sea are primarily bottom-up, strongly structured by salinity, but top-down forcing related to changes in cod abundance also shapes the ecosystem. Changes in the eastern Scotian Shelf that were originally attributed to declines in groundfish are better explained by changes in stratification. Our review suggests that trophic cascade regime shifts are rare in open ocean ecosystems and that their likelihood increases as the residence time of water in the system increases. Our work challenges the assumption that negative correlation between consecutive trophic levels implies top-down forcing.},

	abstract = {{MaxEnt} is a program for modelling species distributions from presence-only species records. This paper is written for ecologists and describes the {MaxEnt} model from a statistical perspective, making explicit links between the structure of the model, decisions required in producing a modelled distribution, and knowledge about the species and the data that might affect those decisions. To begin we discuss the characteristics of presence-only data, highlighting implications for modelling distributions. We particularly focus on the problems of sample bias and lack of information on species prevalence. The keystone of the paper is a new statistical explanation of {MaxEnt} which shows that the model minimizes the relative entropy between two probability densities (one estimated from the presence data and one, from the landscape) defined in covariate space. For many users, this viewpoint is likely to be a more accessible way to understand the model than previous ones that rely on machine learning concepts. We then step through a detailed explanation of {MaxEnt} describing key components (e.g. covariates and features, and definition of the landscape extent), the mechanics of model fitting (e.g. feature selection, constraints and regularization) and outputs. Using case studies for a Banksia species native to south-west Australia and a riverine fish, we fit models and interpret them, exploring why certain choices affect the result and what this means. The fish example illustrates use of the model with vector data for linear river segments rather than raster (gridded) data. Appropriate treatments for survey bias, unprojected data, locally restricted species, and predicting to environments outside the range of the training data are demonstrated, and new capabilities discussed. Online appendices include additional details of the model and the mathematical links between previous explanations and this one, example code and data, and further information on the case studies.},

	abstract = {1 Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2 This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees ({BRT}), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final {BRT} model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3 Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in {BRT} overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although {BRT} models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4 The unique features of {BRT} raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using {BRT} through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of {BRT} by ecologists.},

            Defining and attaining suitable management goals probably represent the most difficult part of ecosystem-based fisheries management. To achieve those goals we ultimately need to define ecosystem overfishing in a way that is analogous to the concept used in single-species management. Ecosystem-based control rules can then be formulated when various ecosystem indicators are evaluated with respect to fishing-induced changes. However, these multi-attribute control rules will be less straightforward than those applied typically in single-species management, and may represent a gradient rather than binary decision criteria. Some ecosystem-based decision criteria are suggested, based on indicators empirically derived from the Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Further development in the translation of ecosystem indicators into decision criteria is one of the major areas for progress in fisheries science and management.},

A striking feature of many independent trawl-survey datasets is the relative stability of total biomass over several decades, despite overfishing of several commercial species and marked changes in the relative abundance of different species. This relative stability suggests a pattern of species replacements related to compensatory dynamics in the total production of fish biomass. In contrast, sustained declines in overall biomass are evident in other ecosystems. We used trawl-survey data to analyze the mechanisms that regulate stability across 19 marine ecosystems around the world. A linearized, multispecies Gompertz model within a state space framework was fitted to the survey data to quantify interactions among diet-based functional groups and external drivers. The total biomass in 7 of the 19 systems lacked uni- or multidirectional trends and was stationary. The stable ecosystems were associated with lower levels of aggregate community fishing pressure enabling differential rates of growth, immigration and emigration among the different populations to be the important factors regulating community dynamics. Higher levels of fishing pressure tended to synchronize the community response to the external driver resulting in large changes in total biomass. Evidence for interactions among functional groups was relatively weak; however, density dependence at the functional group level suggested within-group compensation as an important stabilizing mechanism.},

Results show that anadromous fishes were detectable and quantifiable in the diets of common marine piscivores for every season sampled. Even though anadromous fishes were not the most abundant prey, they accounted for c. 5–10\% of the diet by mass for several marine piscivores. Statistical comparisons of these data with fish diet data from a broad-scale survey of the north-west Atlantic Ocean indicate that the frequency of this trophic interaction was significantly higher within spatially and temporally focused sampling areas of this study than in the broad-scale survey. Odds ratios of anadromous predation were as much as 460 times higher in the targeted sampling as compared with the broad-scale sampling. Analyses indicate that anadromous prey consumption was more concentrated in the near-coastal waters compared with consumption of a similar, but more widely distributed species, the Atlantic herring Clupea harengus. In the context of ecosystem-based fisheries management, the results suggest that even low-frequency feeding events may be locally important, and should be incorporated into ecosystem models.},

            Multispecies stock assessment models require predator diet data, e.g. stomach samples. Diet data can be unavailable, sparse, of small sample size, or very noisy. It is unclear if multispecies interactions can be estimated without bias when interactions are weak. Research is needed about how model performance is affected by the availability or quality of diet data and by the method for fitting it. We developed seven age-structured operating models that simulate trophic interactions for two fish species and different scenarios of diet data availability or quality. The simulated data sets were fitted using four statistical catch-at-age models that estimated fishing, predation and residual natural mortality and differed in the way the diet data was fitted. Fitting the models to diet data averaged over time should be avoided since it resulted in estimation bias. Fitting annual diet composition per stomach produced bias estimates due to the occurrence of zeros in the observed proportions and the statistical assumptions for the diet model. Fitting to annual stomach proportions averaged across stomachs led to unbiased results even if the number of stomachs was small, the interactions were weak or some sampled years and ages were missing. These methods should be preferred when fitting multispecies models.},

Niche variation is usually established by testing the null hypothesis that individuals draw from a common resource distribution. This approach encourages a publication bias in which negative results are rarely reported, and obscures variation in the degree of individual specialization, limiting our ability to carry out comparative studies of the causes or consequences of niche variation. To facilitate studies of the degree of individual specialization, this paper outlines four quantitative indices of intrapopulation variation in resource use. Traditionally, such variation has been measured by partitioning the population's total niche width into within- and between-individual, sex, or phenotype components. We suggest two alternative measures that quantify the mean resource overlap between an individual and its population, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of all four measures. The utility of all indices depends on the quality of the empirical data. If resources are measured in a coarse-grained manner, individuals may falsely appear generalized. Alternatively, specialization may be overestimated by cross-sectional sampling schemes where diet variation can reflect a patchy environment. Isotope ratios, parasites, or diet–morphology correlations can complement cross-sectional data to establish temporal consistency of individual specialization.},

In this study, we clarify this concept by reviewing the strengths and limitations of different approaches commonly used to define and measure ecological specialization. We first show that ecological specialization can either be considered as reflecting species’ requirements or species’ impacts. We then explain how specialization depends on species-specific characteristics and on local and contingent environmental constraints. We further show why and how ecological specialization should be scaled across spatial and temporal scales, and from individuals to communities. 3. We then illustrate how this review can be used as a practical toolbox to classify widely used metrics of ecological specialization in applied ecology, depending on the question being addressed, the method used, and the data available. 4. Synthesis and applications. Clarifying ecological specialization is useful to make explicit connections between several fields of ecology using the niche concept. Defining this concept and its practical metrics is also a crucial step to better formulate predictions of scientific interest in ecology and conservation. Finally, understanding the different facets of ecological specialization should facilitate to investigate the causes and consequences of biotic homogenization and to derive relevant indicators of biodiversity responses to land-use changes.},

	abstract = {1. Apex predators are often assumed to be dietary generalists and, by feeding on prey from multiple basal nutrient sources, serve to couple discrete food webs. But there is increasing evidence that individual level dietary specialization may be common in many species, and this has not been investigated for many marine apex predators. 2. Because of their position at or near the top of many marine food webs, and the possibility that they can affect populations of their prey and induce trophic cascades, it is important to understand patterns of dietary specialization in shark populations. 3. Stable isotope values from body tissues with different turnover rates were used to quantify patterns of individual specialization in two species of ‘generalist’ sharks (bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas, and tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier). 4. Despite wide population-level isotopic niche breadths in both species, isotopic values of individual tiger sharks varied across tissues with different turnover rates. The population niche breadth was explained mostly by variation within individuals suggesting tiger sharks are true generalists. In contrast, isotope values of individual bull sharks were stable through time and their wide population level niche breadth was explained by variation among specialist individuals. 5. Relative resource abundance and spatial variation in food-predation risk tradeoffs may explain the differences in patterns of specialization between shark species. 6. The differences in individual dietary specialization between tiger sharks and bull sharks results in different functional roles in coupling or compartmentalizing distinct food webs. 7. Individual specialization may be an important feature of trophic dynamics of highly mobile marine top predators and should be explicitly considered in studies of marine food webs and the ecological role of top predators.},

This ‘individual specialisation’ is a widespread phenomenon in natural populations, but until recently few studies quantified the magnitude of individual specialisation and how this magnitude varies among populations or contexts. Such quantitative approaches are necessary for us to understand how ecological interactions influence the amount of among-individual variation, and how the amount of variation might affect ecological dynamics. Herein, we review recent studies of individual specialisation, emphasising the novel insights arising from quantitative measures of diet variation. Experimental and comparative studies have confirmed long-standing theoretical expectations that the magnitude of among-individual diet variation depends on the level of intra and interspecific competition, ecological opportunity and predation. In contrast, there is little empirical information as to how individual specialisation affects community dynamics. We discuss some emerging methodological issues as guidelines for researchers studying individual specialisation, and make specific recommendations regarding avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Many of the world's rivers are ice-covered during winter months but increasing evidence indicates that the extent of river ice will shift substantially as winters warm. However, our knowledge of rivers during winter lags far behind that of the growing season, limiting our understanding of how ice loss will affect rivers. Physical, chemical, and biological processes change from headwaters to large rivers; thus, we expect ice processes and resulting effects on the ecology of rivers could also vary with river size, as a result of the associated changes in geomorphology, temperature regimes, and connectivity. To conceptualize these relationships, we review typically disparate literature on ice processes and winter ecology and compare what is known in the smallest and largest rivers. In doing so, we show that our ability to link ice with ecology across river networks is made difficult by a primary focus on ice processes in larger rivers and a lack of study of ecosystem processes during winter. To address some of these gaps, we provide new scenarios of river ice loss and analyses of how the annual importance of winter gross primary productivity ({GPP}) varies with river size. We show projected ice loss varied with large-scale watershed characteristics such as north-south orientation and that the importance of winter to annual {GPP} was greatest in the smallest rivers. Finally, we highlight information needed to fill knowledge gaps on winter across river networks and improve our understanding of how rivers may change as climate and ice regimes shift.},

The Gulf of Maine presents a test case of this paradigm, as temperatures have warmed extremely rapidly. Some species have shifted northeastward, matching predictions. Others—namely harmful algal species like Pseudo-nitzschia australis and Karenia mikimotoi—do not appear to have followed climate trajectories, arriving as surprises in the Gulf of Maine. Rare-biosphere dynamics offer one possible ecological lens for understanding and predicting this type of surprise. Rare species in the plankton, possibly more so than southerly ones, may provide management challenges in the future. Improved monitoring and broader coordination of monitoring of the rare biosphere could help develop early warning systems for harmful and toxic algae. A better theoretical understanding of rare biosphere dynamics is also needed. A challenge for the next cohort of ecosystem projections is to predict the newly emerging harmful species of the type that catch us by surprise.},

A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determining species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolutionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and discusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consideration of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limitations can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context.},

Extinction prediction suffers from a number of limitations related to data and the novelty of future environments. We suggest additional attention to (1) identification of variables related to biodiversity that are diagnostic and potentially more predictable than extinction, (2) constraints on species dispersal and reproduction that will determine population persistence and range shifts, including limited sources or potential immigrants for many regions, and (3) changes in biotic interactions and phenology. We suggest combinations of observational and experimental approaches within a framework available for ingesting heterogeneous data sources. Together, these recommendations amount to a shift in emphasis from prediction of extinction numbers to identification of vulnerabilities and leading indicators of change, as well as suggestions for surveillance tools needed to evaluate important variables and the experiments likely to provide most insight.},

	abstract = {The impact of invasive plants on stream baseﬂow has mostly focused on water-limited areas such as South Africa and the southwestern region of the United States. However, there is evidence suggesting that rivers in areas traditionally considered to be water-rich (e.g. the northeastern United States) will be facing water shortages in the foreseeable future. Consequently, it is imperative to understand what impact invasive plants in this region may have on river baseﬂows. In early June 2008, pressure sensors to monitor stream depth were placed upstream and within a stretch of river containing Japanese knotweed on the bank. Knotweed daily photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration patterns were recorded during the course of two day-long periods at the end of July, 2008. At the beginning of August 2008, all of the knotweed plants in the study area were cut at the base and their leaves were harvested to determine total leaf area for the site. Pre-harvest stream water levels were found to be signiﬁcantly lower than post-harvest stream levels within the stretch containing knotweed. In contrast, in the upstream location, baseﬂows decreased between pre-harvest and post-harvest. Furthermore, on the basis of the physiological measurements and total leaf area, it was estimated that the plants in the study area removed through transpiration about 1556 l or 10.4 mm of groundwater per day from the system. These ﬁndings suggest that the presence of knotweed within riparian habitats may have even more deleterious effects on water resources than previously considered and merit future research.

Habitat suitability curves ({HSCs}) based on frequency of habitat use (ﬁsh occurrence relative to available habitat) remain the most widely used biological models in habitat simulations. However, in some contexts ﬁsh density may be a poor indicator of habitat quality, leading to biased predictions of optimal ﬂow. We explore the use of bioenergetics to derive mechanistic {HSCs} based on the fundamental energetics of habitat use. Using ﬂow-related changes in production of Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch smolt as reference data to evaluate model predictions, we found that bioenergetic-based {HSCs} matched the validation data better than frequency-based {HSCs}, which systematically underestimated optimal ﬂows. However, biases remained using bioenergetic {HSCs}, suggesting that habitat suitability may not be independent of discharge as is often assumed. Declining invertebrate drift concentration, increasing temperature, and density dependence of growth at low ﬂows are potential mechanisms of ﬂow-related declines in habitat suitability; measuring these effects and incorporating them into ﬂow models is an important step in further improving model predictions, particularly at low ﬂows.},

However, many researchers rely on a few published literature sources to obtain {ED} values because of time and sampling constraints on measuring {ED} with bomb calorimetry. Literature values often do not account for spatial or temporal variability associated with invertebrate {ED}. Thus, these values can be unreliable for use in models and other ecological applications. We evaluated the generality of the relationship between invertebrate {ED} and proportion of dry-to-wet mass ({pDM}). We then developed and tested a regression model to predict {ED} from {pDM} based on a taxonomically, spatially, and temporally diverse sample of invertebrates representing 28 orders in aquatic (freshwater, estuarine, and marine) and terrestrial (temperate and arid) habitats from 4 continents and 2 oceans. Samples included invertebrates collected in all seasons over the last 19 y. Evaluation of these data revealed a significant relationship between {ED} and {pDM} (r2 = 0.96, p , 0.0001), where {ED} (as J/g wet mass) was estimated from {pDM} as {ED} = 22,960pDM 2 174.2. Model evaluation showed that nearly all (98.8\%) of the variability between observed and predicted values for invertebrate {ED} could be attributed to residual error in the model. Regression of observed on predicted values revealed that the 97.5\% joint confidence region included the intercept of 0 (2103.0 6 707.9) and slope of 1 (1.01 6 0.12). Use of this model requires that only dry and wet mass measurements be obtained, resulting in significant time, sample size, and cost savings compared to traditional bomb calorimetry approaches. This model should prove useful for a wide range of ecological studies because it is unaffected by taxonomic, seasonal, or spatial variability.},

We present a low cost, commercially available automated acoustic receiver system from which presence/absence data can be used to infer diel activity patterns. We monitored a large, temperate labrid, Tautoga onitis, but the methods and analyses presented here have direct application to other marine species. Data were analyzed using graphical analysis, harmonic analysis, and empirical eigenfunction analysis. Diel activity patterns were expressed in the context of photoperiod, water temperature, and tidal flow. Detection periodicity was strongly diel (24-h cycle), with detection predominantly during daylight hours only (diurnal). Diurnal detection persisted throughout the study. Daily detection was greatest in the morning or afternoon during slack tide. Daily detection varied seasonally with ambient water temperature and was greatest between 13-20°C, corresponding to the primary fishing seasons for Tautoga onitis in spring and fall. This study represented the first use of automated acoustic receivers to investigate seasonal changes in diel activity patterns of adult tautog and only the second application of ultrasonic telemetry to study this species. This study was also the first to address diel activity patterns of adult tautog in the southern range of this species' distribution.[{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

	abstract = {Winter dormancy is used by many animals to survive the cold and food-poor high-latitude winter. Metabolic rate depression, an active downregulation of resting cellular energy turnover and thus standard (resting) metabolic rate ({SMR}), is a unifying strategy underlying the persistence of organisms in such energy-limited environments, including hibernating endotherms. However, controversy exists about its involvement in winter-dormant aquatic ectotherms. To address this debate, we conducted simultaneous, multi-day measurements of whole-animal oxygen consumption rate (a proxy of metabolic rate) and spontaneous movement in a model winter-dormant marine fish, the cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus). Winter dormancy in cunner involved a dampened diel rhythm of metabolic rate, such that a low and stable metabolic rate persisted throughout the 24 h day. Based on the thermal sensitivity (Q10) of {SMR} as well as correlations of metabolic rate and movement, the reductions in metabolic rate were not attributable to metabolic rate depression, but rather to reduced activity under the cold and darkness typical of the winter refuge among substrate. Previous reports of metabolic rate depression in cunner, and possibly other fish species, during winter dormancy were probably confounded by variation in activity. Unlike hibernating endotherms, and excepting the few fish species that overwinter in anoxic waters, winter dormancy in fishes, as exemplified by cunner, need not involve metabolic rate depression. Rather, energy savings come from inactivity combined with passive physico-chemical effects of the cold on {SMR}, demonstrating that thermal effects on activity can greatly influence temperature–metabolism relationships, and illustrating the benefit of simply being still in energy-limited environments.},

	abstract = {Understanding the promotion and regulation of circadian rhythms in marine fishes is important for studies spanning conservation, evolutionary biology, and physiology. Given numerous challenges inherent to quantifying behavioral activity across the full spectrum of marine environments and fish biodiversity, case studies offer a tractable means of gaining insights or forecasting broad patterns of diel activity. As these studies continue to accumulate, assessing whether, and to what extent, the cumulatively collected data are biased in terms of geography, habitat, or taxa represents a fundamentally important step in the development of a broad overview of circadian rhythms in marine fish. As such investigations require a phylogenetic framework, general trends in the phylogenetic sampling of marine fishes should be simultaneously assessed for biases in the sampling of taxa and trait data. Here, we compile diel activity data for more than 800 marine species from more than five decades of scientific studies to assess general patterns of bias. We found significant geographic biases that largely reflect a preference toward sampling warm tropical waters. Additionally, taxonomic biases likewise reflect a tendency toward conspicuous reef associated clades. Placing these data into a phylogenetic framework that includes all known marine fishes revealed significant under-dispersion of behavioral data and taxon sampling across the whole tree, with a few subclades exhibiting significant overdispersion. In total, our study illuminates substantial gaps in our understanding of diel activity patterns and highlights significant sampling biases that have the potential to mislead evolutionary or ecological analyses.},

Model complexity is typically constrained via a process known as L1 regularization, but at present little guidance is available for setting the appropriate level of regularization, and the effects of inappropriately complex or simple models are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate the use of information criterion approaches to setting regularization in Maxent, and we compare models selected using information criteria to models selected using other criteria that are common in the literature. We evaluate model performance using occurrence data generated from a known “true” initial Maxent model, using several different metrics for model quality and transferability. We demonstrate that models that are inappropriately complex or inappropriately simple show reduced ability to infer habitat quality, reduced ability to infer the relative importance of variables in constraining species' distributions, and reduced transferability to other time periods. We also demonstrate that information criteria may offer significant advantages over the methods commonly used in the literature.},

Sizebased feeding strategies were assessed through comparison of frequency distributions of relative prey sizes eaten and were related to general predator feeding tactics and gape morphology. The results demonstrated that the range of prey sizes eaten expanded with increasing predator body size for each of the marine predators examined, leading to asymmetric predator size - prey size distributions. Absolute maximum prey size and slopes of maximum prey size versus predator size varied widely among predator taxa. Distinct size-based feeding strategies were evident, as diets of some predators were dominated by prey that were 10 to 20\% of predator size, whereas other predators frequently consumed prey {\textgreater} 50\% of predator size. Gape sizes and allometric relationships with body size were also diverse among predators and often were closely associated with maximum prey sizes.

	abstract = {Trophic guild analysis identifies groups of species that use similar resources within a community. We evaluated the trophic guild structure in an assemblage of 40 fish species in the Northeast United States shelf ecosystem using a 25 yr database of food habits. We explicitly accounted for ontogenetic diet shifts by separating predator species into size classes. There were 14 significant trophic guilds. These distinguished predators based upon prey size and location in the water column (i.e., benthic to pelagic feeding). Ontogenetic diet shifts were important in guild structure, particularly within dominant piscivores. The mean dietary overlap both between and within guilds was notably lower than in other fish communities due to the broad spatial and temporal scale of the study, the diversity of prey types consumed, and the generalist nature of predators in this system. The guild concept is a useful framework to simplify highly connected, complex ecosystems like the Northeast {US} continental shelf and identify ecologically similar functional units.},

	abstract = {Integrating food web indicators into ecological status assessments is central to developing effective management measures that can improve degraded ecosystems. This is because they can reveal how ecosystems respond to environmental change that cannot be inferred from studying habitat, species or assemblages alone. However, the substantial investment required to monitor food webs (e.g. via stomach contents analysis) and the lack of internationally agreed approaches to assessing them has hampered their development. Inventories of trophic interactions have been collated world-wide and across biomes, and can be applied to infer food web structure and energy flow. Here, we compile a new marine dataset containing 8,092 unique predator–prey interactions from 415,294 fish stomachs. We demonstrate how feeding guilds (i.e. groupings based on diet and life stage) could be defined systematically and in a way that is conducive to their application internationally across ecosystems; and apply them to the North Sea fish assemblage to demonstrate their responsiveness to anthropogenic pressures. We found evidence for seven distinct feeding guilds. Differences between guilds were related to predator size, which positively correlated with piscivory, phylogeny, with multiple size classes of a species often in the same guild, and habitat, as pelagic, benthic and shallow-coastal foraging was apparent. Guild biomasses were largely consistent through time at the North Sea-level and spatially aggregated at the regional level with change relating to changes in resource availability, temperature, fishing and the biomass of other guilds. This suggests that fish biomass was partitioned across broad feeding and environmental niches, and changes over time were governed partly by guild carrying capacities, but also by a combination of covariates with contrasting patterns of change. Management of the North Sea ecosystem could therefore be adaptive and focused towards specific guilds and pressures in a given area. Synthesis and applications. We propose a food web indicator which has been explicitly called for to inform policy via food web status assessment as part of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the indicator toolkit supporting The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (the ‘{OSPAR} Convention’).},

	title = {Seasonal feeding and movement responses of resident sculpin in the Canadian Arctic},
	abstract = {Environments change across space and time, requiring organisms to adapt behaviorally and/or physiologically. In the Arctic, where productivity varies greatly among seasons, many marine species exploit a resource pulse associated with annual ice melt. Melting sea-ice releases zooplankton on and within the ice into open water causing many consumers to migrate with the receding ice; however, resident species may too rely on the ephemeral prey source. Fourhorn Sculpin (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) and Slimy Sculpin (Cottus cognatus) are residents of Tremblay Sound, Nunavut Canada which is known as a seasonally productive system in the Arctic. I characterized the seasonal behavior of sculpin by collecting and identifying stomach contents from 175 sculpin during the ice-free periods of 2017-2019. Other individuals were released with acoustic transmitters (n=119) for year-round monitoring of movements throughout Tremblay Sound. Consumption rates were high, with 33\% of individuals consuming {\textgreater}5\% of their body mass (mean 4.32\%; {SE} 0.25). Diet composition was dominated by amphipods and krill but both traditional and multivariate analyses showed diets shifted and broadened over the short ({\textasciitilde}6 weeks) ice-free season and between years. Namely, indicator species analysis revealed significant associations with distinct amphipod genera between years (Gammaracanthus sp. in 2017, Onisimus sp. in 2018). Feeding exploitation corresponded with high rates of activity as several metrics of movement and home range consistently revealed more activity during the ice-free period. Further analyses revealed qualitatively that sculpin showed high site fidelity and were residents within Tremblay Sound year-round, though acceleration and pressure sensors indicate individuals may not be entirely dormant under the ice. Together, showing high levels of activity to feed at high levels while maintaining flexibility in diet composition indicates that sculpin are adapted to exploit ephemeral resources. These physiological and behavioral adaptations are likely important to annual energy budgets and have potential to affect the resilience of sculpin to ongoing climate change in marine Arctic ecosystems.},

Apart from intuitive designations of guild membership, four statistically-based protocols are currently available: those of Colwell (1977); Holmes (1979); Lawlor (1980); and Adams (1985). The first is based on nearest-neighbor variance in overlap, the second on multivariate statistics, the third on clustering techniques, and the fourth on psychometric analysis. We propose a fifth approach, first developed by Strauss (1982) for purposes other than guild recognition. We advocate the use of bootstrap procedures to resample any given empirical matrix of consumers by resources, within constraints set by either of four different randomization algorithms. Subsequently, pseudovalues of similarity in resource use between the consumers are computed and their frequency distribution is displayed in a histogram. The overlap pseudovalue that exceeds percentile 95 may be considered statistically significant and chosen as the cutoff point that identifies significant species clusters (guilds) in the original (empirical) similarity matrix. We exemplify use of this approach with the food-niche matrix obtained for a predatory assemblage in California, and discuss its implications for the general analysis of guild structure.},

These groups can be used to study a number of important ecological concepts, including functional diversity, community response to disturbance, and food-web dynamics. Despite increased use, guild membership can be based on subjective criteria that are arbitrarily chosen, leading to inconsistencies across studies. Additionally, studies using the guild approach generally ignore ontogenetic changes in diet and habitat use and therefore do not fully capture the complexity of aquatic communities. Although these issues have been discussed in the literature, much has changed since the last review was published a decade ago. In our examination, we discuss data requirements and consequences of data availability and reliability on guild formation. We identify bootstrapping and permutation techniques developed to address limitations through cluster validation and the identiﬁcation of ontogenetic shifts prior to guild delineation.

Sculpins responded to three different classes of chemical stimuli: (1) cues of predatory brook trout, (2) damage-released alarm cues from conspeciﬁc sculpins, and (3) disturbance cues from conspeciﬁc sculpins. Sculpins did not distinguish between trout fed different diets; however, the presence of damage-released alarm cues did enhance the intensity of response to the predator chemicals. A histological analysis of the skin of sculpins revealed the presence of large sacciform cells that may act as the source of chemical alarm signals.},

We tested the ability of larval threespine sticklebacks to adjust their foraging in the presence of predators by exposing them to conspecific predators of various sizes and recording their foraging and predator avoidance behaviours. Larvae ({\textless}30 days post-hatch) displayed predator escape behaviours only towards attacking predators. At 3 weeks post-hatch larvae approached the predator after fleeing, a behaviour which may be the precursor to predator inspection. Larvae reduced foraging and spent less time in the proximity of large and medium-sized predators compared to small predators. The reduction in foraging was negatively correlated to the predator/larva size ratio, indicating that larvae increased their foraging as they increased in size relative to the predator. We conclude that larval sticklebacks can assess the threat of predation early in their ontogeny and adjust their behaviour accordingly.},

Sculpins in fresh water lakes (Myoxocephalus thompsoni [Girard]) lack cephalic horns and live well below a depth of 10 m . Those in the sea (Myoxocephalus quadricornis [Linnaeus]) typically live above 10 m and possess a well developed set of four cephalic horns . The sculpins in Garrow Lake, North West Territories, are intermediate between the marine and fresh water forms with respect to their depth distributions and their cephalic horns (spines) . As a consequence, Garrow Lake, which separated from the sea some 3000 years ago, serves as an excellent `laboratory' for studying evolutionary changes in this sculpin . The age of the lake was based on carbon-14 dates of the fossil pelecypods from raised beaches around the lake and from observations of rates of isostatic rebound in the area as reported by Dickman \& Ouellet 1983 and Page et al. 1984 . During the last 3000 years, the surface waters of Garrow Lake have freshened and its sculpins have apparently adapted to this top down freshening by occupying a depth where the salinity of the lake approaches that of sea water. As a result, the sculpin population in Garrow Lake lives deeper than the sculpin population in the nearby Garrow Bay . Thus, the deeper dwelling Garrow Lake sculpins appear to be less vulnerable to avian predation than their shallow water dwelling marine ancestors . It is hypothesized that reduced avian predation of the Garrow Lake sculpin population is associated with the observed reduction in their cephalic horns which impart a certain degree of disruptive colouration and disruptive pattern outline allowing the shallow dwelling marine species to blend in with its background in a manner which appears to make it less visible to avian predators . It is unfortunate that the three thousand year old Garrow Lake sculpin population is now endangered by mine tailings entering the lake from the nearby Cominco Ltd . mine. The entire food chain of the lake appears to have been severely impacted by lead and zinc mine tailings entering Garrow Lake at a rate of 100 metric tonnes per hour .},

	abstract = {The warming of the world’s oceans has resulted in the redistribution of many marine species globally. As species undergo range shifts, the expanding edge of the population often experiences novel environmental and demographic conditions that may result in the emergence of variation in life-history strategies. The northern stock of black sea bass, Centropristis striata, has recently expanded its distribution poleward, into the Gulf of Maine. Management has struggled to keep pace with this rapid range shift, in part, because very little is known about the expanding population. We compared life-history traits of black sea bass collected from 2013 to 2016 from the northern most point of the historic range of the northern stock (southern Massachusetts) to those from two areas in the newly expanded range (northern Massachusetts and Maine). We found signiﬁcant differences in size, diet, condition, maturity and sex ratio between black sea bass from southern Massachusetts and the Gulf of Maine. Overall, sea bass in the newly expanded range consumed a less diverse diet and their condition was lower, but they reached maturity at a younger age. We also found greater length- and age-at-maturity estimates from all regions combined compared to the most recent black sea bass stock assessment which includes data from Cape Hatteras, {NC} to southern Massachusetts. This study represents initial observations of life-history traits of sea bass in its newly expanded range in the Gulf of Maine, and suggests that these sea bass exhibit lifehistory strategies that differ from their southern counterparts within their historic range. Given these ﬁndings, the stock assessment for the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf black sea bass stock may not be adequate for sea bass in the Gulf of Maine. Studies investigating the expanding edge of economically valuable ﬁshery species are needed to aid in ongoing and future efforts to assess and manage their stocks.},

	abstract = {Integrating food web indicators into ecological status assessments is central to developing effective management measures that can improve degraded ecosystems. This is because they can reveal how ecosystems respond to environmental change that cannot be inferred from studying habitat, species or assemblages alone. However, the substantial investment required to monitor food webs (e.g. via stomach contents analysis) and the lack of internationally agreed approaches to assessing them has hampered their development. Inventories of trophic interactions have been collated world-wide and across biomes, and can be applied to infer food web structure and energy flow. Here, we compile a new marine dataset containing 8,092 unique predator–prey interactions from 415,294 fish stomachs. We demonstrate how feeding guilds (i.e. groupings based on diet and life stage) could be defined systematically and in a way that is conducive to their application internationally across ecosystems; and apply them to the North Sea fish assemblage to demonstrate their responsiveness to anthropogenic pressures. We found evidence for seven distinct feeding guilds. Differences between guilds were related to predator size, which positively correlated with piscivory, phylogeny, with multiple size classes of a species often in the same guild, and habitat, as pelagic, benthic and shallow-coastal foraging was apparent. Guild biomasses were largely consistent through time at the North Sea-level and spatially aggregated at the regional level with change relating to changes in resource availability, temperature, fishing and the biomass of other guilds. This suggests that fish biomass was partitioned across broad feeding and environmental niches, and changes over time were governed partly by guild carrying capacities, but also by a combination of covariates with contrasting patterns of change. Management of the North Sea ecosystem could therefore be adaptive and focused towards specific guilds and pressures in a given area. Synthesis and applications. We propose a food web indicator which has been explicitly called for to inform policy via food web status assessment as part of the European Union's Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the indicator toolkit supporting The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (the ‘{OSPAR} Convention’).},

	abstract = {The northern shrimp (
              Pandalus borealis
              Krøyer) population in the Gulf of Maine collapsed during an extreme heatwave that occurred across the Northwest Atlantic Ocean in 2012. Northern shrimp is a boreal species, and reaches its southern limit in the Gulf of Maine. Here we investigate proximate causes for the population collapse using data from fishery-independent surveys, environmental monitoring, and the commercial fishery. We first examined spatial data to confirm that the decline in population estimates was not due to a major displacement of the population, and then tested hypotheses related to fishing mortality and shifts in predation pressure. Fishing mortality may have contributed but could not explain the magnitude of the decline or the disappearance of pre-exploitable size individuals. Stomach contents analysis and biomass trends revealed no new fish predators of shrimp. However, longfin squid (
              Doryteuthis pealeii
              Lesueur) was unique among all species in showing time-series biomass peaks during spring, summer and fall of 2012, and spatial overlap with northern shrimp was unusually high in 2012. Longfin squid is a voracious and opportunistic predator that consumes crustaceans as well as fish. We hypothesize that the warmer temperatures of 2012 not only led to expansion of longfin squid distribution in Gulf of Maine, but had differential effects on migration phenology that further increased spatial overlap with northern shrimp. The weight of our evidence suggests that longfin squid predation was likely a significant factor in the collapse of northern shrimp in the Gulf of Maine.},

	abstract = {Species around the world are shifting their ranges in response to climate change. To make robust predictions about climate-related colonizations and extinctions, it is vital to understand the dynamics of range edges. This study is among the first to examine annual dynamics of cold and warm range edges, as most global change studies average observational data over space or over time. We analyzed annual range edge dynamics of marine fishes—both at the individual species level and pooled into cold- and warm-edge assemblages—in a multi-decade time-series of trawl surveys conducted on the Northeast {US} Shelf during a period of rapid warming. We tested whether cold edges show stronger evidence of climate tracking than warm edges (due to non-climate processes or time lags at the warm edge; the biogeography hypothesis or extinction debt hypothesis), or whether they tracked temperature change equally (due to the influence of habitat suitability; the ecophysiology hypothesis). In addition to exploring correlations with regional temperature change, we calculated species- and assemblage-specific sea bottom and sea surface temperature isotherms and used them to predict range edge position. Cold edges shifted further and tracked sea surface and bottom temperature isotherms to a greater degree than warm edges. Mixed-effects models revealed that for a one-degree latitude shift in isotherm position, cold edges shifted 0.47 degrees of latitude, and warm edges shifted only 0.28 degrees. Our results suggest that cold range edges are tracking climate change better than warm range edges, invalidating the ecophysiology hypothesis. We also found that even among highly mobile marine ectotherms in a global warming hotspot, few species are fully keeping pace with climate.},

	abstract = {Managing natural resources in an era of increasing climate impacts requires accounting for the synergistic effects of climate, ecosystem changes, and harvesting on resource productivity. Coincident with recent exceptional warming of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and removal of large predatory fish, the American lobster has become the most valuable fishery resource in North America. Using a model that links ocean temperature, predator density, and fishing to population productivity, we show that harvester-driven conservation efforts to protect large lobsters prepared the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery to capitalize on favorable ecosystem conditions, resulting in the record-breaking landings recently observed in the region. In contrast, in the warmer southern New England region, the absence of similar conservation efforts precipitated warming-induced recruitment failure that led to the collapse of the fishery. Population projections under expected warming suggest that the American lobster fishery is vulnerable to future temperature increases, but continued efforts to preserve the stock’s reproductive potential can dampen the negative impacts of warming. This study demonstrates that, even though global climate change is severely impacting marine ecosystems, widely adopted, proactive conservation measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate change.},

	abstract = {The Gulf of Maine has recently experienced its warmest 5-year period (2015-2020) in the instrumental record. This warming was associated with a decline in the signature subarctic zooplankton species, Calanus finmarchicus. The temperature changes have also led to impacts on commercial species such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American lobster (Homarus americanus) and protected species including Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) and northern right whales (Eubalaena glacialis). The recent period also saw a decline in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) recruitment and an increase in novel harmful algal species, although these have not been attributed to the recent warming. Here, we use an ensemble of numerical ocean models to characterize expected ocean conditions in the middle of this century. Under the high {CO}2 emissions scenario ({RCP}8.5), the average temperature in the Gulf of Maine is expected to increase 1.1°C to 2.4°C relative to the 1976-2005 average. Surface salinity is expected to decrease, leading to enhanced water column stratification. These physical changes are likely to lead to additional declines in subarctic species including C. finmarchicus, American lobster, and Atlantic cod and an increase in temperate species. The ecosystem changes have already impacted human communities through altered delivery of ecosystem services derived from the marine environment. Continued warming is expected to lead to a loss of heritage, changes in culture, and the necessity for adaptation.},
