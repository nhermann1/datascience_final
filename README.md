# Final Project

This is Nathan Hermann's final project for BIOL 806: Data Science for Life Sciences. Included in this repository is the necessary data to follow the initial dive into my project that I complete. The project I am exploring is the Nutritional Ecology of Climate Change (NECC) project collaboration between Nathan Furey of UNH and Kathy Mills of GMRI. Further detail is included in proposal.pdf, or .Rmd to see behind-the-scenes, which serves as a draft to propose the first chapter of my PhD dissertation.
